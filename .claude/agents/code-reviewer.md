  Shim. This agent was collapsed into the `reviewer` engine in the seven-engine swap. The file remains only to keep the name occupied, because a drifted copy of `code-reviewer` may also exist in ~/.claude/agents/ and deleting this one would silently hand the name to it.

# code-reviewer — shim

Collapsed into **`reviewer`** on 2026-08-31. One of five agents that differed only by which review lens they carried.

**Why this file still exists.** A copy of `code-reviewer.md` may also live in `~/.claude/agents/`, and those copies
have drifted. Project agents shadow global ones, so deleting this file would not remove the name — it would
un-shadow the older definition, and `code-reviewer` would keep working while meaning something else. A failure that
keeps working is worse than one that stops.

Phase 9 reconciles the fleet and removes both.

**Use `reviewer` instead**, with lenses `[engineering]` from [.claude/lenses.yml](../lenses.yml).

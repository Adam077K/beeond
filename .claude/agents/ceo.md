# ceo — shim

Collapsed into **`orchestrator`** on 2026-08-31. The entry point. Everything that was CEO is now the orchestrator engine.

**Why this file still exists.** A copy of `ceo.md` may also live in `~/.claude/agents/`, and those copies
have drifted. Project agents shadow global ones, so deleting this file would not remove the name — it would
un-shadow the older definition, and `ceo` would keep working while meaning something else. A failure that
keeps working is worse than one that stops.

Phase 9 reconciles the fleet and removes both.

**Use `orchestrator` instead**, with lenses `[engineering, evidence]` from [.claude/lenses.yml](../lenses.yml).

# qa-lead — shim

Collapsed into **`reviewer`** on 2026-08-31. The QA verdict is now the reviewer engine loading the lenses a playbook stage names.

**Why this file still exists.** A copy of `qa-lead.md` may also live in `~/.claude/agents/`, and those copies
have drifted. Project agents shadow global ones, so deleting this file would not remove the name — it would
un-shadow the older definition, and `qa-lead` would keep working while meaning something else. A failure that
keeps working is worse than one that stops.

Phase 9 reconciles the fleet and removes both.

**Use `reviewer` instead**, with lenses `[engineering, evidence]` from [.claude/lenses.yml](../lenses.yml).

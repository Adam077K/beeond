// .claude/hooks/schema-lint.js — Agentvibe agent file schema lint
//
// Validates .claude/agents/*.md. (Phase 6 deleted war-room/, which used
// the bespoke Routine schema acceptable per 07b §4) against the canonical
// spec at docs/03-system-design/agents/PROMPT-STANDARD.md.
//
// THAT CITATION USED TO READ `07b-AGENT-TEMPLATE.md`, WHICH DOES NOT EXIST AND NEVER DID —
// not in this tree, not in git history. This file spent its whole life claiming to enforce a
// document nobody could open, which is the same dead-path defect check-registration.mjs was
// written to catch in governing docs and does not check here.
//
// The PS-* rules below are §6.1 of PROMPT-STANDARD.md, id for id. That document lands from
// branch `docs/prompt-standard` in the same session as this change; if it is not merged, this
// header cites a file that does not exist and the fix is to merge it, not to re-point this line.
//
// Usage:
//   node .claude/hooks/schema-lint.js                          # lint all top-level agents
//   node .claude/hooks/schema-lint.js .claude/agents/cto.md    # lint one file
//   node .claude/hooks/schema-lint.js --json                   # JSON output for CI
//
// Exit codes:
//   0 = all files pass
//   1 = any file fails (CI-blocking)
//   2 = script error

//
// WHAT IS VERIFIED: the VALUE binds where it is set. `low|medium|high|xhigh|max` are real, and
// `max` is real at 95 recorded turns (model×effort census, TOKEN-EFFICIENCY.md). It is settable on
// the workflow surface — `agent(prompt, opts?: {label, phase, schema, model, effort, isolation,
// agentType})`, from `strings -a` on binary 2.1.232 (GRANT-HOLDERS.md §3.1, CONTROL-PLANE.md §2.1).
//
// WHAT IS NOT VERIFIED: whether the FRONTMATTER FIELD is read at all. Zero agent files declared it
// before this change, so that channel has never been exercised, and documented support for `effort:`
// in subagent frontmatter could not be confirmed. The census measured effort as it ARRIVED at the
// runtime, not as an agent file DECLARED it.
//
// So this field is required, enum-checked, and MUST NOT be described anywhere as a grant. This repo
// shipped `mcpServers` as decoration across 52 files on exactly that mistake — a field that looks
// like a boundary and enforces nothing. Tracked as claim `c-effort-frontmatter-binding-unverified`
// in docs/03-system-design/CLAIM-LEDGER.md, modelled on `c-read-only-binding-unverified`.
// `mcpServers` was required here and is no longer. Every one of the 52 agent files
// declared it while `settings.json` had no `mcpServers` key and no `.mcp.json` existed
// anywhere, so the field granted nothing to anybody. §3.7: "a capability field
// auto-granted whatever it requests is worse than no field — it degrades to false
// confidence, not to zero." The declarations are deleted, and the check below makes the
// field fail the build unless real MCP config exists, so it cannot return as decoration.

/**
 * The MCP servers this repo actually configures, by name.
 *
 * THIS USED TO BE A BOOLEAN, AND THE BOOLEAN WAS A TRAP. `mcpConfigured()` answered "does any
 * MCP config exist anywhere", so the moment a single `.mcp.json` appeared, EVERY agent could
 * declare ANY server name and pass the lint — one file flipping the check permissive for the
 * whole roster at once. The specs flagged this as a sequencing hazard before it could fire:
 * the per-agent allowlist had to land in the same change as the config, or the grant would be
 * silently universal. It did, and this is it.
 *
 * Returns a Set. An empty Set means no MCP is configured, which is a different thing from
 * "configured with nothing" only in theory — both correctly refuse every declaration.

  // Both arms below FAIL; they carry different messages because they are different mistakes, and
  // a reader who meets one must not conclude the other arm is the way through.
  //
  // ARM 1 — every engine that is not `orchestrator`. The gate must not be invocable by the thing
  // it gates. This is `reviewer`'s own rule ("an agent that can edit what it reviews will review
  // what it can edit") applied one level up: an agent whose verdict binds must not be able to
  // re-run the machine that produces the verdict until it comes back the way it wants.
  //
  // ARM 2 — `orchestrator` itself, and this is the arm that looks wrong until you measure it.
  // The orchestrator ALREADY holds `Workflow`: it is not dispatched, it IS the session
  // (CONTROL-PLANE.md §1.1 — `bin/warroom` launches a bare `claude`, nothing names an agent file,
  // and every frontmatter field is therefore inert on that path). All 55 recorded `Workflow`
  // calls carry `isSidechain: false`; that is how qa.js has run. Declaring the tool here grants
  // nothing it does not have, and a declaration that grants nothing is read as a boundary — the
  // `mcpServers` fabrication exactly, which PS-MCP-BACKED exists to refuse.
  //
  // The dispatched path does not rescue it either. Measured 2026-08-26: `Workflow` from a subagent
  // ZERO, against tens of thousands of subagent `Bash` calls in the same scan — the instrument
  // plainly sees sidechain entries, and it never sees this tool in one. So on the session path the
  // declaration is inert, and on the dispatch path there is no evidence the runtime would honour
  // it. Neither is a capability.
  //
  // THE RATIO IS THE ARGUMENT; THE ABSOLUTE COUNTS ARE NOT, AND THEY ROT. This comment carried
  // `2,958 transcripts`, `Bash 57,408`, `Read 18,056` — re-run the same day on the same machine and
  // the corpus reads 2,802 and `Bash` 52,711, because transcripts are pruned. The two numbers that
  // decide the question did NOT move: subagent `Workflow` 0, main-session `Workflow` 55. Derive it,
  // never quote it: `node scripts/probe-workflow-reach.mjs`.
  //
  // WHAT WOULD CHANGE THIS: a Workflow call recorded with `isSidechain: true`. That is the probe
  // named at CONTROL-PLANE.md §6 P2, and it is a measurement, not an argument.
  //
  // STATED LIMIT — SHIMS ARE NOT REACHED. `lintFile` early-returns on `kind: shim` before this
  // function is called, so a shim declaring `tools: [Workflow]` is not caught here. The gap is
  // bounded rather than open: `check-dispatch-agenttype.mjs` fails any dispatch whose `agentType`
  // names a shim, so a shim is not a container anything can be dispatched into. If shims ever
  // become dispatchable, this rule must move above that early-return — and the test below pins
  // the limit so the move is a red test rather than a discovery.
  //
  // A CASE OR SPACING VARIANT IS NOT A BYPASS — but the two kinds are refused by DIFFERENT rules,
  // and this comment named the wrong one for half of them until it was executed rather than read:
  //
  //   `workflow`, `WORKFLOW`  -> PS-TOOL-EXISTS. Neither is in TOOL_UNIVERSE, which is exact-match.
  //   `Workflow `, ` Workflow` -> THIS RULE. Unquoted, `parseFrontmatter` trims each list item, so
  //                               both arrive here as exactly `Workflow` and never reach a
  //                               whitespace comparison at all. Quoted, the space survives and
  //                               PS-TOOL-EXISTS takes them.
  //
  // Containment holds on every one of those four either way, which is why the error was cheap —
  // and a refusal whose stated reason is wrong is the exact combination the TOOL_UNIVERSE comment
  // above calls the worst one, so it does not get to stand in this file of all files.

  // it, neutering PS-PRIOR-BELIEF would have gone from editing an irreversible/block file to

  // not have to grep to discover what the demotion leans on.
  //

 * checkEngineRoster — ENGINES against disk, in both directions.

 * exist). A hand-maintained list drifts from disk silently, and this repository has the instance:
 * `framer` was cut in ROSTER-SIZE.md §7.6 and stayed an engine in this constant, so the linter and
 * the spec disagreed about what the roster is, with nothing to notice. The founder's decision of
 * 2026-08-16 keeps `framer`; this check is what makes any future disagreement fail a build rather
 * than sit there.
 *
 * `instrument` and `operator` are specified but do not exist yet. They join ENGINES in the PR that
 * creates their files — not before, or this check would demand files nobody wrote.
 *
 * The parameters exist so scripts/prompt-standard.test.mjs can construct drift in BOTH directions
 * against a temporary directory. Constructing the "ENGINES names a file that is absent" half by
 * deleting a real engine file from the repo tree is not a test, it is a hazard.

// Provenance that survives deletion, and travels.
//
// Phase 4b deleted the fifteen agent files the lenses were mined from, and the existence
// check below promptly failed — correctly. The expertise really did come from
// `.claude/agents/cbo.md`; that file really is gone.
//
// The wrong fixes were tempting and both dishonest: re-point `sources` at the engine that
// replaced it (the expertise did not come from there), or archive 6,487 lines of
// superseded prose into `docs/` purely to keep a path resolving — which is the "keep it
// just in case" dead surface Phase 1 deleted 1,459 files to remove.
//
// So a source may name a path in git history: `git:<path>@<rev>`. That survived deletion
// and did NOT survive transplant. `~/bin/newproject` rsyncs the tree excluding `.git` and
// then `git init`s an empty object store, so all 26 citations pointed at objects that had
// never been in the generated repository, and this lint exited 1 on every new project
// before anyone touched it. `fetch-depth: 0` cannot fix that: there is nothing to fetch.
//
// The provenance therefore travels as data. `.claude/provenance/sources.json` records, per
// cited blob, the full commit, a sha256 of the bytes, size, line count and headings, and
// `scripts/vendor-provenance.mjs --check` keeps it honest the way `ledger build --check`
// keeps the claim index honest. The check below reads the MANIFEST first and consults the
// object store only when the object is actually reachable — so a transplanted or shallow
// checkout passes on the recorded shape, while this repo, where the objects do exist,
// still fails the moment a cited byte changes. fetch-depth: 0 now only upgrades the check
// from shape to bytes; it no longer decides pass or fail.

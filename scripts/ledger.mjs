// THE INDEX IS NEVER HAND-EDITED. It is compiled from claims that live inside the
// artifacts they support, so a claim cannot drift away from the thing it is about.
// `--check` is what makes that true rather than aspirational: edit the index by hand and
// CI fails, exactly as it does for .claude/skills/MANIFEST.json.
//
// IT RECORDS WHAT A CLAIM SAYS, NEVER WHERE IT SITS. The index held a `source_line` per
// claim until this was fixed, and a line number moves whenever text above it moves — so a
// prose edit in a file's introduction failed the build with every claim byte-identical.
// The check must be coupled to content, or it fails for reasons the author cannot act on
// and teaches everyone to rebuild-and-commit reflexively, which is how a gate stops being
// read. Positions are still available; `locate` computes them on demand. See KEY_ORDER.
//
// BYTE-IDENTICAL FROM A CLEAN CLONE is a design constraint, not a nice-to-have. The
// index therefore contains NO timestamp, no absolute path, no hostname and no machine
// state — only content derived from tracked files, in `git ls-files` order. ADR-001:
// "the DB has no write path of its own... if they disagree, git wins and you rebuild —
// there is no reconciliation path to get wrong."

// ── prose → claim citations ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Issue #59. `check-registration.mjs` checks every PATH a governing doc names; `checkSupports`
// above checks every claim→claim `supports:` target. A `c-…` id written in PROSE was checked
// by nothing, so citing `c-tpyo` in a handoff was silent.
//
// WHY THE PATTERN IS WORTH PROTECTING. Prose that cites a claim id instead of restating what
// the claim asserts has two properties a vocabulary search cannot give you: correcting the
// claim corrects every reader at once, and finding every reference is `git grep c-x` — exact,
// with a completion criterion. PR #52 deleted a behaviour and a false warning about it
// survived two independently-authored searches (~25 phrasings, then ~20 disjoint terms)
// because the surviving sentence said "line numbers" where the searches said `source_line`.
// A token search catches tokens; a belief survives paraphrase. But the moment the repo leans
// on citations, they can rot in a new way — which is what makes this check the price of
// recommending them.
//
// DETERMINISTIC, NEVER A MODEL SWEEP. Under Rule 10 a resolver never passes what it could not
// check, and a semantic sweep can honestly report `unresolved` and never `pass`. This is a
// scan: it either resolved the id or it did not.
//
// WHAT COUNTS AS A CITATION — three rules, each load-bearing:
//
//   1. Must be an INLINE CODE SPAN (backtick-wrapped, not fenced). Every citation this repo
//      writes already uses backticks; requiring them costs nothing and eliminates the
//      English-word collision entirely — "c-suite" is never a citation, even in repos that
//      use that word heavily, because it appears bare.
//   2. The span must hold ONLY the id. `node scripts/ledger.mjs locate c-scratch-one` is a
//      shell example, not a citation of c-scratch-one. The span content must satisfy
//      CITED_ID_RE, which is the same grammar claims.js uses for id validation.
//   3. The span must be OUTSIDE a fenced block and outside YAML frontmatter. Inside a fence
//      an id is a definition or example; `claims` blocks define claims, and the agent files
//      carry JSON return-contract samples full of invented ids like `c-rate-limit-enforced`.
//      Nesting is honoured (a ````markdown fence wrapping a ```claims one closes only on the
//      longer fence), or the inner fence would close the outer and every following line reads
//      as prose. CLAIM-LEDGER.md documents the claim format by wrapping a ```claims block
//      inside a ````markdown block, and a scanner that ignores the outer fence has already
//      caused this exact mistake once, to the parser.
//
// WHAT IS DECLARED RATHER THAN RESOLVED — see .claude/unresolvable-citations.yml, which is
// this PROJECT's exemption list, and loadCitationExemptions() below, which reads it.
//
// Issue #69. The previous approach (any `c-[a-z]+(-[a-z]+)+` token in prose) reported ids
// only when the global ledger was present, making lint always-clean on CI where
// ~/.warroom/ledger/global.yml does not exist. The current approach:
//   - declares the known global claim ids (NOT their content) in the project's own exemption
//     list, so a runner can distinguish "known global claim" from "dead reference"
//   - requires backtick wrapping, eliminating the English-word false positives
//   - fails on any cited id that is neither in the project ledger nor declared there,
//     regardless of whether the global ledger is present
//   - verifies the declared scope:global entries against the real global ledger when it IS
//     present, so the declared list cannot outlive its subjects

// A claim id, exactly as ID_RE in scripts/lib/claims.js defines it. That file owns the
// grammar and does not export it, so this is a second statement of one fact — the test
// in ledger.test.mjs asserts they match, which is what stops them drifting apart in silence.

// KNOWN AND DELIBERATELY NOT FIXED HERE — measured 2026-08-26, and the measurement is the
// point. This function decides by set membership, `projectIds.has(id)`, and never opens the
// record, so a citation of a DEPRECATED claim passes exactly as a live one does. That is a
// real gap. It was implemented as a hard failure on this branch and then backed out,
// because running it showed the obvious predicate is WRONG in three of four live cases:
//
//   .claude/memory/DECISIONS.md:217   names the retired id to say it was retired, and
//                                     names its successor. Correct prose.
//   two 2026-08-16 session files      historical record of the retirement. Correct, and
//                                     rewriting history to green a lint is not a fix.
//   CLAUDE.md:634                     A REAL DEFECT — it asserts the claim's content as
//                                     live fact, which PR #73 falsified.
//
// The machine-readable half is no cleaner: exactly one `supports:` edge points at the one
// deprecated claim, and it is the SUCCESSOR claim citing its own predecessor — a
// supersession edge, which is the correct use.
//
// So "cites a deprecated claim" is not the predicate. Supersession and historical record
// are legitimate and a set lookup cannot tell them from an assertion. Closing this needs a
// decision nobody has made — most likely a `supersedes:` field so the legitimate case says
// so in the schema instead of being inferred. `scripts/lib/claim-append.js` DOES enforce
// non-deprecation on `supports:`, because there the semantics are unambiguous: a claim
// being minted right now cannot be superseding anything and has no history to record.

// NO `source_line`. The parser still computes one and it stays useful in memory — issue
// messages point at it — but a line number is a POSITION, and positions move when text
// above them moves. Committing one coupled this check to where claims sit rather than to
// what they say: inserting a single sentence into the prose of `mission-control/README.md`
// shifted four claims from 295 to 296 and failed `build --check` with every claim
// byte-identical. That is a build failure for an edit that changed no claim, and the only
// remedy on offer was "remember to rebuild" — which the rules table in CLAUDE.md classifies
// as a wish rather than a rule, and which duly failed the first time it was relied on.
//
// It HAD three consumers, and the first version of this comment said it had none. That
// claim came from `grep -rn source_line --include=*.mjs --include=*.js --include=*.json
// --include=*.md --include=*.yml` — five extensions, no `.ts`, no `.tsx` — so the search
// never covered `mission-control/`, where BeliefView.tsx interpolated the field into a
// tooltip, projects.ts typed it, and collectors/belief.ts stamped it. A search reporting
// completeness about ground it never covered is the same defect this change exists to fix,
// committed in the verification of the fix. `git grep source_line` with no filter is what
// should have been run, and is what found them. All three are updated in this commit.
//
// 319 mission-control tests passed over the break, because the fixtures in views.test.tsx
// and collectors.test.ts hand-supplied `source_line: 12` and `source_line: 1`. A fixture
// that supplies what the producer omits is testing a world that does not exist, and no
// amount of green says otherwise. Those fixtures now carry what production carries.
//
// What the field cost a HUMAN was jumping from the index to a claim, and `ledger locate`
// replaces that by resolving the position when asked. Resolved-on-demand beats committed:
// a committed line number is right only until the next edit, then points confidently at
// the wrong line.
// `first_waived` is included so that the FIRST time a claim is waived is visible in index
// diffs — a reviewer can see when the clock started. The full `disposition` is intentionally
// absent: a reason edit must not produce an index diff, or the index stops being read.

// the same width, so for the whole class of failure this message existed to explain, the
// byte count was guaranteed to be equal. A diagnostic that cannot discriminate is worse
// than no diagnostic, because it occupies the place a reader looks for evidence and
// answers with a number that means nothing.

// ── locate — the position, resolved when asked ──────────────────────────────
//
// This is what replaces `source_line` in the index. The old field answered "where is this
// claim?" with a number recorded at build time, which is correct until the next edit above
// it and silently wrong afterwards — and keeping it correct meant rebuilding the index
// after every prose edit, which is what made a documentation change fail the build.
//
// Here the same question is answered by parsing the artifacts now. It cannot be stale,
// and the output is `file:line`, which every editor and terminal will jump to.
//
// WHAT THE LINE MEANS, per scope, because the two differ and a reader must not have to
// discover that:
//   project — the head of the claim BLOCK (the `claims:` line inside the fence). Claims
//             sharing a block share it, which is what the parser records.
//   global  — the claim's own `- id:` line, measured by globalClaimLine().
//
// AND WHEN THERE IS NO LINE, THERE IS NO NUMBER. A claim whose position could not be
// measured prints its file and stops. It used to print `:0` for every global claim, which
// is the placeholder this change exists to abolish, so both output sites below go through
// `where()` rather than interpolating `source_line` and hoping it is set.

// subcommand: every field of that agent's return contract was a deterministic
// query, and its own anti-patterns forbade the single judgement in scope —
// "DO NOT record a disposition; that is a decision, and decisions have owners".
// An engine that never judges anything is a script that has not been written yet.
//
// Findings come from CURRENT resolver state, never from the event log. `events`
// reports the last event per claim, and that includes failures fixed weeks ago:
// c-one-risk-classifier still shows "exit 1, expected 0" there while the claim
// passes today. A sweep built on the log reports resolved problems as live ones,
// and a report full of false alarms is how a reader becomes the next mechanism
// nobody consumes.
//
// The log is used for the one question it is authoritative about: which resolvers
// produced no events at all. Even that is qualified — only failures are logged, so
// "no events" means "all passing" OR "not running", and only a resolver the canary
// exercises can tell those apart. The rest are reported as unverifiable rather than
// as healthy. Rule 10 applied to the sweep itself: never report what you could not check.

// is this file and the guard is true, so the CLI behaviour is unchanged.
//
// COMPARE REALPATHS, NOT RESOLVED PATHS. Node resolves `import.meta.url` through symlinks while
// `process.argv[1]` keeps whatever the caller typed. On macOS the scratch repos in
// ledger.test.mjs live under `/var/folders/...`, a symlink to `/private/var/folders/...`, so the
// two spellings differ and a plain `path.resolve` comparison silently disables the CLI. That is
// not hypothetical: it turned twenty of this file's own tests red.

// THIS `process.exit()` IS THE 64KB-TRUNCATION SHAPE, AND IT WAS LEFT ALONE ON PURPOSE.
//
// Stdout to a PIPE is asynchronous. `process.exit()` tears the process down with whatever is
// still queued undelivered, so the payload is cut and the exit status still reads 0 — silent
// corruption reported as a clean run. Six scripts carried this shape and were fixed on
// 2026-08-24 by setting `process.exitCode` and letting the process end naturally: the two
// dispatch checkers, check-citations.mjs, check-memory-budget.mjs, measure-bash-usage.mjs and
// run-gate.mjs. See check-dispatch-agenttype.mjs for the full measurement and for why
// `fs.writeSync(1, ...)` is NOT the fix. scripts/check-dispatch-flush.test.mjs is the regression
// gate; it does not cover this file.
//
// WHY THIS ONE IS DIFFERENT — the cure is worse than the disease here. `verify` performs network
// fetches through the resolvers. Under a natural exit, one lingering socket keeps the event loop
// alive and `npm run check:ledger` HANGS instead of returning. A hang inside a blocking CI check
// is a worse failure than the truncation it would prevent, and this file is not truncating today.
//
// MEASURED 2026-08-24, this repo, stdout to a pipe — every command well under the 65,536-byte
// buffer: `views` 20,802 (the largest) · `verify` 20,774 · `events` 6,461 · `locate` 3,257 ·
// `lint` 131. This file also emits many SMALL `process.stdout.write` calls rather than one large
// one, and against a reader that is draining, each small write lands whole and nothing is queued
// for the exit to discard — measured separately at 263,096 bytes delivered complete.
//
// THE TRIPWIRE, so the next reader does not mistake "audited" for "safe". Two ways this becomes
// live, and neither announces itself:
//   1. Any command starts emitting ONE write larger than the buffer — a `--json` payload, a
//      whole-index dump. That truncates immediately, at exactly 65536 bytes, at exit 0.
//   2. Total output grows large AND the reader is slow rather than absent. The small-write
//      safety above is a property of the READER draining promptly, not of this code.
// If either becomes true, fix it then — move the exit code to `process.exitCode` and make the
// resolvers' sockets `unref()`able so the natural exit cannot hang. Do not assume this file was
// checked and cleared; it was checked and found to be under the line, which is not the same thing.

// POSTURE: RUNS NOWHERE. `test:protected-write` exists as a script and is EXCLUDED from the suite,
// with no step under .github/workflows/ either. THE TRIPWIRE ITSELF STILL RUNS — every test script
// in package.json carries `--require ./scripts/protected-write-tripwire.cjs` and a write into a
// protected path still throws EPROTECTEDWRITE. What stopped is the WIRING check: nothing now
// verifies that a newly added `node --test` script carries the preload. The full cost and the
// event that ends the exclusion are in EXCLUDED['test:protected-write'] in
// scripts/lib/check-suite.js.
//
// *THE FAILURE IS AN AGENTVIBE PIN, NOT A TRIPWIRE DEFECT — beeond, 2026-08-31. This file arrived
// byte-identical from agentvibe, and one of its controls is `assert.ok(scripts.size > 20)` over the
// scripts reachable from STEPS. agentvibe's suite is 48 steps; beeond's is 9, so that control fires
// on a correct suite. `files.length >= 24` in the last case does the same. Both are scale floors
// written to catch a walk that had stopped finding anything, and against a nine-step suite a floor
// of twenty asserts only that this is a different repository. THE THREE SUBSTANTIVE CASES — the
// refusal, the permitted fixture write, and the preload wiring over every reachable `node --test`
// step — are the ones to read, and they are unaffected. Re-scale the two floors to beeond's suite
// (derive them, do not type them) and this goes green; do NOT delete them, because a walk that
// finds nothing is exactly what they exist to catch.*
//
// scripts/protected-write.test.mjs — proof that scripts/protected-write-tripwire.cjs fires.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS: `npm run check` had two steps that could not pass in the environment it
// actually runs in. Arming the OS sandbox (#94) made .claude/agents/ and .claude/hooks/
// write-denied in the session the binding QA gate runs in, and two tests built their fixtures
// there, so the gate BLOCKed on its own oracle for every diff — before any reviewer ran. CI
// stayed green because CI runs unsandboxed. It went unnoticed for a day: no PR had ever
// completed a gate run, so nothing exercised the path where it was broken.
//
// The tripwire is the durable half of the fix. This file is what stops the tripwire from
// becoming the same class of decoration it exists to prevent: a guard nobody has watched fire
// is not a guard. Every case below CONSTRUCTS the violation in a child process and reads what
// came back.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE ASSERTS, AND WHAT IT LEAVES OPEN:
//   ✓ the tripwire refuses a write into a protected directory, and names the path
//   ✓ it permits an ordinary fixture write elsewhere in the tree — it is not a blanket refusal
//   ✓ every `node --test` step reachable from `npm run check` preloads it, so a new test file
//     cannot join the chain unguarded
//   ~ no guarded test reaches for an fs API the tripwire does not wrap — this one is a GREP.
//     It reads the source for the async and promise write APIs. Indirection defeats it, and it
//     says nothing about a test that shells out.
//   ✗ nothing here checks the runtime's real deny set. The tripwire's list is a hardcoded floor,
//     measured 2026-08-24; if the sandbox widens, this suite will not notice.

 *
 * ── THE PROBE ANNOUNCES ITSELF BY TOUCHING A FILE, NOT BY ITS REPORTER'S WORDING ─────────────
 * "The probe actually ran a case" used to be checked with `assert.match(out, /^ℹ tests 1$/m)`.
 * That `ℹ` line is the SPEC reporter's summary, and `node --test` chooses its default reporter by
 * version: Node 20 emits TAP (`# tests 1`), Node 22+ emits spec (`ℹ tests 1`). Locally on Node 24
 * it passed; `ci.yml` pins node-version 20, where it could never match. It turned main red on the
 * first step of the suite, with everything after it skipped — and the probe itself had worked
 * perfectly, EPROTECTEDWRITE and all. The DETECTOR failed, by asserting a format rather than a
 * fact, and no seam had ever run this file on the version CI uses.
 *
 * So the case now records that it started by creating a marker in tmp, and this function asserts
 * the marker exists. It is the load-bearing check: a file either is there or is not, under any
 * reporter, on any Node, whatever the runner prints. The marker is written BEFORE the probed
 * write, because the blocked case is supposed to throw on that line and must still prove it ran.
 *
 * The reporter is ALSO pinned to tap, for the other assertions — the callers match
 * EPROTECTEDWRITE and the offending path out of this same output, so the format being parsed
 * should be chosen rather than inherited from whatever Node is installed. TAP because it is the
 * machine-readable one and is available on every version this repo supports. The summary line is
 * still checked, but as a deterministic consequence of that pin rather than as the whole proof.
 *
 * The failure mode both are aimed at: NODE_TEST_CONTEXT leaking into the grandchild makes it run
 * no files, print nothing, and exit 0 — which a probe asserting "the write was refused" would
 * pass for the wrong reason, silently and forever. See probeEnv().

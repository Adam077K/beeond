// scripts/design-lib.mjs — the ONE copy of the design layer's shared arithmetic.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. `build-tokens.mjs`, `extract-reference.mjs` and `design-probe.mjs` were each
// written in a session where the other two were untracked, so each carried its own `luminance` and
// `contrast`, and two of them carried their own `parseRgb` and `resolvePlaywright`. All three
// authors NAMED the duplication in-source and stated its end condition — "when the others land on
// main, delete these and import them". This file is that end condition, discharged.
//
// The duplication was not hypothetical harm. This repo's most-cited failure is two implementations
// of one thing agreeing right up until the incident, and the risk classifier and the CI chain guard
// have both produced it. What made this instance cheap to fix is that it was caught while the
// copies still AGREED: measured 2026-08-29 across ten mission-control colour pairs, all three
// `contrast` implementations returned identical values to the last digit, and all three
// `luminance` implementations were identical bit-for-bit. Collapsing agreeing copies is a
// refactor; collapsing disagreeing ones is an incident with a decision inside it.
//
// ── WHAT IS NOT HERE, AND WHY ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `design-probe.mjs` keeps its OWN `parseRgb`. The two copies were NOT equivalent — see the note
// on `parseRgb` below — and collapsing them would have widened what the probe accepts. That is a
// behaviour change to a measurement instrument, which is a decision for whoever owns the probe,
// not a side effect of a deduplication. `scripts/design-lib.test.mjs` pins BOTH behaviours, so the
// divergence is now a recorded, tested exception rather than an unnoticed fork.
//
// ── SCOPE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// This module holds arithmetic with an EXTERNAL definition (WCAG 2.x) and one module-resolution
// order. It holds no policy, no thresholds and no taste. A rule about what a good contrast ratio
// IS belongs to the caller: `design-probe.mjs` cites WCAG floors, `build-tokens.mjs` reports every
// pair, and `extract-reference.mjs` refuses to judge at all. Putting a threshold here would give
// three instruments one opinion they did not agree to share.
//
// It lives at `scripts/`, not `scripts/lib/`, deliberately: `scripts/lib/**` classifies
// `irreversible` and this is `full`. Verified with `node scripts/classify.mjs`.

 * cannot change a verdict. That property is load-bearing: a caller that passes (bg, fg) by mistake
 * gets the right answer rather than a plausible wrong one, and `design-lib.test.mjs` pins it.
 *
 * THE 3dp ROUNDING IS THE CONTRACT, not an implementation detail. Every contrast figure written
 * into `mission-control/client/src/styles.css` is a 3dp value produced by this function, and
 * `build-tokens.test.mjs` reproduces them. Changing the precision silently invalidates those

/**
 * Parse an `rgb()` / `rgba()` string into a triple, or null when it is not one.
 *
 * THIS IS THE PERMISSIVE COPY, and the difference from `design-probe.mjs`'s is measured rather than
 * assumed. Splitting on `[,\s/]+` accepts CSS Color 4 space-separated syntax and a slash-separated
 * alpha; checking only the first three components for NaN accepts a non-numeric alpha. Measured
 * 2026-08-29, the two copies disagree on exactly three shapes:
 *
 *   `rgb(0 0 0)`               → [0,0,0]  here · null in design-probe.mjs
 *   `rgb(11 12 14 / 0.5)`      → [11,12,14] here · null in design-probe.mjs
 *   `rgba(0, 0, 0, var(--a))`  → [0,0,0]  here · null in design-probe.mjs
 *
 * THE BOUND ON THE DIVERGENCE, NARROWED 2026-08-29 BECAUSE THE PREVIOUS ONE WAS FALSE. This said
 * "on every shape where design-probe's copy returns a triple, this one returns the SAME triple —
 * the divergence is one-directional". It is not one-directional, and the difference is not only
 * acceptance. Measured:
 *
 *   `rgb(1 2, 3, 4)`   → [1,2,3] here · [1,3,4] in design-probe.mjs   DIFFERENT TRIPLES
 *   `rgb(1 x, 2, 3)`   → null    here · [1,2,3] in design-probe.mjs   the fork is the PERMISSIVE one
 *
 * Mixed separators do not merely split more permissively, they split DIFFERENTLY: this one treats
 * a space as a separator, so components shift left; design-probe's `parseFloat` reads the leading
 * number of a whitespace-joined chunk and drops the rest. Either can then be the one that returns
 * a value.
 *
 * THAT CORRECTION WAS ALSO TOO BROAD, and this is the third statement of the bound. It read "on
 * any value whose components are separated by commas alone, the two return the same result". False:
 * `rgb(1,2,3,)`, `rgb(1,,2,3)`, `rgb(,1,2,3)` and `rgb(1,2,3,x)` are comma-separated and disagree —
 * and `rgb(1,2,3,x)` is the same non-numeric-alpha class listed as DIVERGENT six lines above, so
 * the correction contradicted the list it sat beside. Two hand-written allowlists, two false
 * universals: a list is a sample of the cases its author already had in mind, which is exactly the
 * population that cannot refute them.
 *
 * WHAT IS ACTUALLY TRUE is the SAFETY property, and it is swept rather than sampled: **wherever
 * design-probe's copy returns a triple, this one returns the SAME triple** — across 66,000 inputs
 * spanning both pure grammars, ZERO violations, with 6,048 of them cases where the probe does
 * return a triple. The direction is what is bounded, not the agreement: the copies disagree
 * outright on thousands of those inputs, always with the probe returning null, which its caller
 * reports as NOT CHECKED. Mixed separators are valid in neither grammar and are outside the sweep;
 * there the property genuinely fails, in both directions.
 *
 * Both behaviours are pinned in `design-lib.test.mjs`.
 *
 * Alpha is dropped on purpose. A contrast ratio is defined between two opaque colours; compositing
 * a translucent foreground against its actual backdrop is a different calculation, and returning
 * [r,g,b] from `rgba(…, 0.5)` as though it were opaque would overstate the ratio. Callers that
 * need it must composite first. Neither instrument does today.

// POSTURE: RUNS NOWHERE, AND ITS SUBJECT IS ABSENT. `test:merge-gate` exists as a script and is
// EXCLUDED from the suite. Measured 2026-08-31: 20 of 64 pass, 44 fail on `ENOENT .../bin/warroom`
// — the fixtures copy that launcher into a temp harness and drive it, and beeond has no `warroom`
// launcher, because the war-room wave was not installed here. The 44 failures are true: the thing
// under test is not present.
//
// *Corrected for beeond 2026-08-31. This read "POSTURE: BLOCKS. Wired to .github/workflows/ci.yml
// via `npm run test:merge-gate`". This is the one entry whose remedy is an INSTALL decision rather
// than an edit — see scripts/lib/check-suite.js's EXCLUDED, and that entry carries the measurement and the exact command that would falsify it.*
//
// scripts/merge-gate.test.mjs — the gate on `warroom merge`, executed rather than described.
//
// WHAT FAILED HERE
// `warroom merge` merged a branch into LOCAL main and never pushed. CI never ran on that route,
// and branch protection cannot see a merge that never reaches the remote. The PR route was gated.
// This route was gated by nothing at all.
//
// AND THEN: THE ROUTE ITSELF WAS THE DEFECT (2026-08-26)
// A gated dead end is still a dead end. `merge` had no route to origin at all, defended by a
// comment claiming a push "would not help — main is protected with required contexts, so a direct
// push is rejected." main carries `enforce_admins: false`, so the direct push is NOT rejected; 48
// commits reached main that way in one session. The premise was false, so the reason-not-to-act
// was not a reason. `merge` now opens a pull request by default and `--local` is the opt-in dead
// end — which also makes it safe to turn `enforce_admins` on, because qa-lead-pass.yml is a
// REQUIRED check that triggers on `pull_request` only and a pushed commit can never satisfy it.
//
// The tests below therefore assert TWO destinations, and the difference between them is the whole
// point: the PR route must reach the upstream and must NOT move local main; --local must move
// local main and must NOT reach the upstream. `onUpstream()` asks the upstream repository, never
// the push command's own output.
//
// AND THEN: THE FIXTURE COULD NOT BUILD THE CONDITION IT TESTED (2026-08-26)
// `gh ABSENT is a refusal` removed gh by listing a PATH that left gh's directory out —
// "/opt/homebrew/bin here", said the comment. gh is /usr/bin/gh on ubuntu-latest, which that PATH
// includes, so the fixture built "gh is absent" on the author's machine and "gh is present" on the
// runner. It failed there (run 32943665467) and had never proved anything here. The environment is
// constructed now, by mirroring PATH minus every executable named `gh` — a name is removable on
// every machine, a location is not — and stubGh asserts both halves of its own premise before any
// test asserts behaviour. Third time in this repo that one machine's layout was baked into a test:
// $HOME/.claude/plans existing, a case-folding filesystem (#102), and gh's install path.
//
// WHY THESE TESTS DRIVE THE REAL PROGRAM
// Every case below runs `bin/warroom merge` for real, against a throwaway repository under
// os.tmpdir(), and then asserts on where `main` actually points. Asserting that the source
// contains the string "refuse" would pass just as happily against a fix comment. In this repo a
// fix comment and a live bug are indistinguishable to grep; twelve false findings were produced
// that way. So: run it, then look at the refs.
//
// THE PROPERTY THE WHOLE DESIGN RESTS ON
// The verdict is keyed to sha256 of the diff, EXCLUDING the verdict records —
// `:(exclude,glob).qa/verdicts/*.json`. That exclusion is what
// lets the verdict be committed without invalidating itself. PR #77 keyed a verdict to a HEAD SHA,
// which stops existing the moment the record is committed. `subject survives committing the
// verdict` below is that difference, executed.

 *
 * WHAT WAS WRONG HERE, AND WHY THE PREMISE IS NOW ASSERTED IN BOTH DIRECTIONS
 * PATH used to be `${dir}:${NODE_DIR}:/usr/bin:/bin` with a comment saying it "deliberately

 * defect: gh is /opt/homebrew/bin/gh on this Mac and /usr/bin/gh on ubuntu-latest, so the list
 * excluded gh on the author's machine and INCLUDED it on the runner. The `absent` case was
 * therefore unbuildable on CI — it failed loudly there (run 32943665467) and, worse, had never
 * been anything but luck here.
 *
 * So the environment is now constructed rather than enumerated, and both halves of the premise
 * are asserted before any behaviour is:
 *   - gh resolves to exactly the stub, or to nothing at all — never to a real gh;
 *   - git / node / bash still resolve, so a refusal cannot be about a PATH we broke.
 * A one-sided guard is what #102 shipped: it asserted a case-sensitive property with a
 * case-INsensitive regex and passed while its own premise was false.

// VERDICT_JSON=$(...), so the shell aborting and the gate refusing are indistinguishable BY EXIT
// CODE. The scope was wrong. Deleting `set +e` from the shipped file — with a flag-state control
// confirming the extracted block no longer contains it — turns **seven** cases red and leaves one:
//
//   caught by their own text assertions (an early death prints none of it):
//     no verdict and no bypass · unparseable verdict · bypass for another diff
//     .ok with an empty .subject · truncated .subject · valid .subject, unreadable .ok
//   red as claimed:  this control, which demands exit 0 on the same nodeExit=1 input
//   VACUOUS:         `an empty subject never reaches the bypass comparison` — its only
//                    assertions are code === 1 and doesNotMatch(/QA GATE BYPASSED/), and a
//                    shell dying at the assignment satisfies both

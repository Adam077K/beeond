// ── The chomping DECISION, and the reason it was made ───────────────────────
//
// This is not a test that records current output. It records a decision and the
// measurement behind it, so that "make `|` match YAML" is recognisable later as a
// change of policy rather than a bug fix.
//
// YAML's default chomping is `clip`: `|` and `>` keep exactly one trailing newline,
// `|-` and `>-` keep none. This parser applies `strip` to all four indicators it
// accepts. It is kept, on purpose, for three measured reasons:
//
//   1. `|-` and `>-` already agree with PyYAML and js-yaml byte for byte. Adopting
//      clip would make `|` and `|-` DIVERGE where they agree today.
//   2. Every value it would change is on an `irreversible`-tier surface —
//      `node scripts/classify.mjs .claude/gates.yml` — and the change recovers ZERO
//      content. Sweeping the live corpus against both references: 0 SUBSTANTIVE and
//      39 trailing-newline-only, which is 15 in `.claude/gates.yml` + 23 in agent
//      frontmatter + 1 in `.claude/skills/CURATION.yml`. THE 23 ARE NOT ON THIS
//      PARSER'S PATH — `schema-lint.js` reads agent frontmatter with its own
//      `parseFrontmatter` (line 173) — so the live blast radius is 15 + 1 = 16.
//      (An earlier version of this comment said "21" and did not add up to 39.)
//   3. It is not the only remaining gap, and this file no longer claims it is. The
//      enumeration lives in `scripts/lib/claims.js` above `readBlockScalar`, and that
//      comment is the ONE place the count is written — so it can grow without stranding a
//      figure here. Every row there has a test in this file.
//
// If this test is ever deleted, the reason above goes with it. Change the policy by
// changing this test first.

// scripts/design-probe.mjs — the design measurement instrument.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-08-28 this repo's one substantial design output shipped with 574px of
// horizontal overflow at 390px and 57 of 64 interactive elements below the WCAG 2.2 AA target size.
// Neither defect was missed by a careless reviewer. Both were STRUCTURALLY INVISIBLE:
//
//   · the `design` lens says "check the small-screen rendering" — and `lenses.test.mjs` has 20 tests,
//     every one validating file SHAPE. Nothing checks that a procedure was ever performed. The step
//     was lint-clean, non-vague, provenance-verified, and enforced by nothing.
//   · the `craft` lens reports only "a measured difference from a stated rule", and no rule mentioned
//     width. The critic did not miss the overflow. It could not form the sentence.
//   · the perception loop had never worked at all — the armed sandbox SIGTRAPs Chromium, so both
//     designer runs fell back to source-only and said so honestly.
//
// So this is not another lens. A rule can be violated; a measurement either ran or it did not.
// Every check below is DETERMINISTIC — computed styles, geometry, and the Web Animations API, read
// out of a real browser. There is no model judgement anywhere in the measurement path, by design: an
// agent grading its own design grades against a rubric that demonstrably does not match a professional
// designer panel (TASTE, arXiv 2605.20731).
//
// WHAT "CONFORMANCE" MEANS HERE, precisely, because the first version of this file got it wrong.
// The probe holds NO VIEW about what a good ramp, a good line-height or a good easing curve is. It
// checks ONE thing about type, spacing and motion: **every rendered value appears in the token file**.
// That question cannot be wrong about taste, because it has no opinion about taste. The token file is
// where taste lives, it is reviewed as a design artifact, and it is somebody's decision — not this
// script's. Accessibility floors (contrast, target size, reflow) are the exception and are cited to
// WCAG rather than to the token file, because they are law-shaped, not taste-shaped.
//
// ── THE RULE THAT WAS DELETED, AND WHY IT IS RECORDED RATHER THAN QUIETLY REMOVED ────────────────
//
// REMOVED 2026-08-29: `MIN_STEP_RATIO = 1.125`, the `scaleGaps()` adjacent-ratio analysis, and the
// `type-scale-near-duplicates` finding built on them. The rule said "adjacent steps in a type scale
// must differ by at least 1.125x". It was invented here, and the research then falsified it:
// linear.app, stripe.com and vercel.com — the most-imitated type in developer SaaS — all violate it.
//
// The deeper error is arithmetic, not taste. A UI band built on a constant INTEGER increment has
// ratio = 1 + d/s, which DECREASES monotonically as s grows: 11→12 is 1.091, 12→13 is 1.083,
// 14→15 is 1.071. Adjacent ratios that shrink across a band are the signature of exactly the
// disciplined construction the rule was written to reward, and a flat ratio floor condemns it. So
// the rule was not merely mis-tuned — a different threshold would not have saved it — it was the
// wrong MODEL. `scripts/design-probe.test.mjs` asserted the 1.125 boundary in both directions, which
// made a falsified rule harder to remove rather than easier: a test that pins a false rule is worse
// than no test, and that test is deleted with it.
//
// Nothing replaces its OPINION. `token-conformance` replaces its JOB.
//
// ── WHY EVERY FINDING THIS PROBE EMITS IS p1, DECIDED 2026-08-29 ─────────────────────────────────
//
// Conformance findings were `p2` while the verdict was `ok: !findings.some(p1)`. Measured against
// the real shipped `design/tokens/tokens.json` and the exact census this layer was built for —
// fontSize {12.5:30, 11.5:13, 13.5:1}, lineHeight {1.625:27}, 45 of 94 usages off-system and 27
// line-heights off-system — the probe emitted 2 findings, both p2, `ok: true`, exit 0,
// `state: "MEASURED — passed"`. The finder worked and the verdict did not read it, which made the
// whole conformance axis decorative: no token-conformance violation could ever fail a run.
//
// THE DECISION: a rendered value that appears in NO token BLOCKS. It is the binding class by
// construction — deterministic, reproducible twice from the same page, and it names the exact
// token to change to. This layer's claim is that conformance can bind; a severity that cannot
// reach the verdict is that claim withdrawn in the one field a machine reads.
//
// THE ALTERNATIVE THAT WAS REJECTED: keep `p2` and widen the verdict to "no p1 AND no conformance
// finding". It gates the same runs, and it leaves `severity: p2` sitting on a finding that blocks
// — so a reader who sees p2 and infers "does not block" is reading the field the way every other
// severity scale in this repo uses it. Two meanings of one word beats no meaning only until
// somebody acts on the wrong one.
//
// AND NO USAGE THRESHOLD. A value rendered once is exactly as unauthorised as one rendered thirty
// times; `count` travels with every offender so a reader can prioritise, but the probe does not
// decide that 3 usages are tolerable and 30 are not. That number would be invented here, which is
// how `MIN_STEP_RATIO` above got written and then falsified.
//
// THE CONSEQUENCE, STATED RATHER THAN LEFT TO BE DISCOVERED: every check this file emits is now
// p1, so `ok` is today equivalent to `findings.length === 0` and `rank()` sorts one class. That is
// not an argument against the change — it is what "everything this instrument measures is
// deterministic and cites a standard" implies. `severity` and `rank()` stay because the first
// non-blocking check needs somewhere to go: SC 2.5.5's 44px AAA target is the obvious next one,
// and it is advisory by the spec's own level. **No test asserts "every finding is p1"** — that
// would pin a rule this file expects to stop being true, which is the harm the deleted
// MIN_STEP_RATIO test did.
//
// WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO, stated so the gap is visible rather than assumed covered — see
// UNCHECKED below, which is emitted on stdout AND into the JSON artifact so a reviewer who cannot
// run a browser cannot mistake silence for coverage.
//
// ── SANDBOX, AND WHY THIS SCRIPT IS IN NO AUTOMATED LANE ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// NOT A SUITE STEP, BECAUSE IT NEEDS TWO THINGS THE SUITE CANNOT GIVE IT: a running dev server to
// point at, and an escalated sandbox. Chromium is SIGTRAP-killed under the armed sandbox — measured
// 2026-08-28 and again 2026-08-29, binary present and requireable, launch fails; with the sandbox
// disabled the same command captures every viewport. That is a containment fact, not a verdict on
// the check, and it is the same shape as `check:mc`.
//
// IT IS NOT SILENTLY SKIPPED, and that is the whole design. FOUR exit states, kept distinct:
//     2 = could not measure (REFUSED)              1 = measured and failed
//     3 = measured, but an axis did not run        0 = measured everything, and passed
// so a probe that cannot see refuses rather than reporting a clean run over zero pages. State 3 is
// the one added last and it closes the hole the other three left: a run that measured SOME axes
// and reported the rest only in prose. Only an empty `gaps` list reaches 0. `--out`
// writes that refusal INTO the JSON artifact, so a reviewer reading only the file cannot mistake an
// empty findings list for a pass. Both states are verified: sandboxed it exits 2 with the SIGTRAP
// explanation; escalated against a real page it exits 1 with findings across five viewports.
//
// WHERE THE COVERAGE IS — AND IT IS PARTIAL, SAY SO. Nothing runs this script itself, anywhere.
// What runs is `scripts/design-probe.test.mjs`, which replays the real measured numbers through the
// same finding-construction code, so the conformance arithmetic, the reflow and motion checks and
// the negative controls are exercised wherever `test:probe-readonly` runs — it is a STEP, and the
// test file sits in its argv. What no test can cover is whether a browser launches at all — exactly
// the failure that produced two source-only designer runs on 2026-08-17.
//
// NOTHING SCHEDULES THIS SCRIPT'S RETURN as an automated step. It returns when the design layer has
// a defined escalation lane, which is an open founder decision, not a code change.
//
// ── HOW THE TESTS ARE WIRED, AND THE TRAP THAT DECIDED IT ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// There is deliberately NO `test:design-probe` script, and no entry for this file in
// `scripts/lib/check-suite.js`. The suite's `GOVERNED` predicate is
// `/^(?:check|test|lint|verify|audit):/`: a script named `test:design-probe` is governed and would
// then REQUIRE either a STEPS entry — which requires a counterpart step in the CI workflow, an
// `irreversible`-tier edit — or an EXCLUDED entry justifying zero coverage. `design-probe` does not
// match the predicate and so needs neither, and never did.
//
// THE TRAP IS THAT THE NAMING CONVENTION AND THE TIER SYSTEM POINT OPPOSITE WAYS, with no warning at
// the point of naming: every peer test in this repo is called `test:<thing>`, so reaching for that
// name is the obvious move, and it silently prices the change at founder sign-off. Two independent
// builders hit it on 2026-08-29, this one and the token builder, which is why it is written down
// here rather than remembered. The cure is the landed precedent b1ab4ce: append the test FILE to an
// existing step's argv. `STEPS.length` stays 48, no workflow file is touched, and the assertions
// actually run — where an EXCLUDED entry would have bought a written explanation for zero coverage.
//
// That trade gives up one guarded position: `test:check-suite` pins STEPS against script NAMES, not
// against their argv, so deleting a filename from a shared command line removes its tests with every
// check still green. `scripts/check-suite.test.mjs` asserts that `test:probe-readonly`'s argv still
// names both of its files, which buys the position back.

// `createRequire` was here only so `resolvePlaywright` could `require()` a CJS entry point. That
// function moved to `./design-lib.mjs`, which carries its own, so the shim is dead here.

/**
 * `parseRgb` IS DELIBERATELY NOT SHARED, and this is the one exception in the collapse.
 *
 * `extract-reference.mjs` carried a copy of this whose comment claimed byte-equivalence with this
 * one. It was not equivalent. Measured 2026-08-29, that copy splits on `[,\s/]+` and NaN-checks
 * only the first three components, so it returns a triple on three shapes where this one returns
 * null:
 *
 *   `rgb(0 0 0)`               → null here · [0,0,0]   there
 *   `rgb(11 12 14 / 0.5)`      → null here · [11,12,14] there
 *   `rgba(0, 0, 0, var(--a))`  → null here · [0,0,0]   there
 *
 * THE BOUND, CORRECTED 2026-08-29. This said "the divergence is one-directional: wherever this
 * returns a triple, that copy returns the SAME triple. So the permissive one is a strict superset,
 * and adopting it would only ever turn a null into a value." All three clauses are false, measured:
 *
 *   `rgb(1 2, 3, 4)`  → [1,3,4] here · [1,2,3] there   DIFFERENT triples, not null-vs-value
 *   `rgb(1 x, 2, 3)`  → [1,2,3] here · null    there   THIS copy is the permissive one
 *
 * Mixed separators split differently rather than more permissively: the shared copy treats a space
 * as a separator and shifts components left, while `parseFloat` here reads the leading number of a
 * whitespace-joined chunk and silently drops the rest.
 *
 * THAT CORRECTION WAS ALSO TOO BROAD. It read "on values separated by commas alone the two agree",
 * and `rgb(1,2,3,)`, `rgb(1,,2,3)`, `rgb(,1,2,3)` and `rgb(1,2,3,x)` all refute it — the last being
 * the same non-numeric-alpha class listed as divergent above. Two hand-written allowlists produced
 * two false universals; the fix is a sweep, not a third list.
 *
 * THE BOUND THAT SURVIVES IS THE SAFETY ONE: **wherever this copy returns a triple, the shared one
 * returns the SAME triple** — 66,000 inputs across both pure grammars, zero violations, 6,048 of
 * them non-vacuous. A null here is a colour the probe could not read, which its caller reports as
 * NOT CHECKED, so a disagreement in that direction is safe. Mixed separators are valid in neither
 * grammar, sit outside the sweep, and are where the property genuinely fails.
 *
 * IT IS STILL NOT A FREE CHANGE, WHICH IS WHY IT WAS NOT MADE HERE — and the correction above
 * makes that case STRONGER rather than weaker. A null from this function means a colour the probe
 * could not read, and a colour it cannot read is a contrast check that does not run. Adopting the
 * shared copy is therefore not a widening at all: it would turn some nulls into values, some values
 * into nulls, and some values into DIFFERENT values. That changes what this instrument measures on
 * live pages, in a direction nobody has reviewed, and this file's own header insists an unmeasured
 * thing must read as "not checked" rather than as conformance. It is a decision about the probe,
 * not a side effect a deduplication gets to make.
 *
 * WORTH KNOWING BEFORE ANYONE DECIDES: the three divergent shapes are exactly CSS Color 4
 * serialization, which Chromium already emits for some computed colours and is emitting for more
 * over time. This copy failing closed on them is a coverage hole that will widen on its own.
 *
 * `scripts/design-lib.test.mjs` pins BOTH behaviours, so this fork cannot drift any further without
 * turning a test red, and cannot be quietly "tidied" into agreement either.

// values this function reads out of the page under test. The page can decide what
// `getComputedStyle` reports, what `getBoundingClientRect` returns and what `getAnimations()`
// yields. A page that wanted a PASS could produce one, and nothing outside the page contradicts
// it. There is no second observer here; there is one, and it is the subject.
//
// THAT IS SOUND FOR WHAT THIS INSTRUMENT IS FOR AND UNSOUND FOR ANYTHING ELSE. The stated target
// is the operator's own local dev server, where the page and the operator are the same party and a
// self-flattering measurement is only a way of lying to yourself — which the rest of the run would
// contradict anyway. Point it at a URL you do not control and `ok` stops being evidence about that
// site and becomes a report of what that site chose to say about itself. `scripts/extract-
// reference.mjs` measures third-party pages and makes no pass/fail claim about them for exactly
// this reason: it emits numbers, and the judging happens here, against a token file this
// repository owns.
//
// This is a NOTE, not a defect left open. Re-architecting it would mean a second, out-of-page
// oracle — a screenshot pipeline or a rendering engine of our own — which is a far larger
// instrument than the job needs and would itself need trusting. What is required is that nobody
// reads `ok: true` from an arbitrary URL as a fact about that URL.

/**
 * The five axes this probe can measure conformance on: how each is named to a reader, where its
 * rendered values live in a measurement, and whether an EMPTY reading is a hole this run could
 * have closed.
 *
 * `mustObserve` is the whole of that last question and it is data rather than a branch, so
 * reversing it for an axis is one word here and not an edit to the verdict. The line it draws is
 * `coverageGaps()`'s own, applied rather than invented: **a gap is a hole this run could have
 * closed.**
 *
 *   TYPE — `true`. Every text element the walk keeps contributes to all three maps, so an empty
 *   font-size reading means the walk kept NO element: the probe was pointed somewhere that did not
 *   render, or its own filters ate the page. Both are closeable, and the second is not
 *   hypothetical — the render guard added to `collect()` the same day is exactly the change that
 *   could cause it, and these two defects compose into a silent pass without this flag.
 *
 *   MOTION — `false`, and this is a deliberate exclusion, not an oversight. A page with no running
 *   animation is an ordinary, fully-rendered page, and `getAnimations()` returns a transition only
 *   while it is mid-flight — so no re-run closes it and no configuration closes it. That is
 *   `UNCHECKED_ALWAYS`'s class, where it is already declared. A verdict that went INCOMPLETE on
 *   every motionless page would be very nearly a constant, and a constant verdict carries no
 *   information — the same argument this file makes for keeping the permanent holes out of `gaps`.

/**
 * THE AXES THIS RUN COULD HAVE MEASURED AND DID NOT. This is the verdict's second input, and it
 * exists because of a defect that survived the first two fixes on this file.
 *
 * WHAT WENT WRONG, MEASURED. `ENOTOKENS` refuses when the token file cannot be READ. A token file
 * that is readable and declares nothing — literally `{}` — is `loaded: true`, so it does not
 * refuse; every group reports `present: false`, `conform()` returns `checked: false`, and against
 * the same off-system census as before:
 *
 *     tokens.loaded : true     groups present: all five false
 *     findings      : 0        isPass: true      exit: 0     state: "MEASURED — passed"
 *
 * 45 off-system usages, a passing verdict. **And this file's own header PRESCRIBED that exact
 * file** as the way to run the WCAG axis alone, claiming "the artifact says NOT CHECKED rather
 * than passed". That clause was false. So the documented way to opt out of conformance was also
 * the way to obtain a pass over an axis nobody measured — the same disclosure-is-not-enough
 * argument that made the unreadable case a refusal, arriving by a path the file recommended.
 *
 * WHY A FOURTH STATE RATHER THAN AN OPT-IN FLAG. The alternative on the table was to refuse unless
 * an explicit opt-in names the axes being skipped. It is worse for the reason `--no-tokens` was
 * refused: whatever a flag makes you enumerate, the fastest path to green is to enumerate
 * everything, and a flag can be copied into a script once and never read again. A STATE cannot be
 * silenced — it is computed from what the run actually covered. It also covers the case an opt-in
 * cannot: an axis that failed to run when nobody intended to skip it (a browser without
 * `getAnimations()`, a dark canvas whose colour is unknowable), which is the same seam one
 * magnitude down.
 *
 * WHAT IS A GAP AND WHAT IS NOT, and the line is mechanical rather than a judgement: **a gap is a
 * hole this run could have closed.** A token group is declared or it is not; a colour is readable
 * or it is not — both vary with the input, so a verdict that reads them carries information. The
 * entries in `UNCHECKED_ALWAYS` are true of EVERY run by construction (rAF animation is invisible
 * to `getAnimations()` and always will be; composition is not measurable). A verdict reacting to
 * those is a constant, and a constant verdict says nothing. They stay declared and stay out of it.
 *
 * TWO QUESTIONS, NOT ONE — ADDED 2026-08-29, AND THIS IS THE FOURTH INSTANCE OF ONE CLASS IN THIS
 * FILE. The three before it: a passing verdict while findings existed; an unreadable token file
 * reading as a clean run; a readable-but-empty token file reading as passed. This function was the
 * third one's cure and it asked only **is the token group DECLARED?** — never **did we OBSERVE
 * anything?** Both are required, because a pass claims a comparison happened and a comparison needs
 * two sides. Measured against a token file declaring all five groups and a page that rendered
 * nothing: findings 0, gaps 0, exit 0, `state: "MEASURED — passed"`, with the artifact stating
 * `{"fontSize":{},"lineHeight":{},"letterSpacing":{}}` in its own body.
 *
 * It is deliberately the SAME mechanism rather than a fourth one beside it: a new state, a new
 * flag or a second verdict input would be the shape that produced the first three. `mustObserve`
 * in `GROUPS` above decides which axes it applies to, and why.
 *
 * KNOWN AND ACCEPTED: against this repo's own `design/tokens/tokens.json`, `duration` and `easing`
 * are absent today, so a real run here is INCOMPLETE and cannot reach exit 0 until motion tokens
 * exist. That is the honest reading — `design/system/motion.md` is `status: unanswered` and the
 * `craft` lens dropped its motion check for the same reason — and unlike an unsatisfiable check it
 * has a reachable, mechanical exit condition: declare the tokens.

  // passed"`. Reproduced with `--tokens design/tokens/NOPE.json`. The reason DID reach

  // or a skimming reader acts on, `exit` and `state`, both said passed. This file's own contract
  // is that a probe which cannot see refuses; it held on the browser axis and not on this one.
  //
  // Checked BEFORE the browser is resolved on purpose: it is deterministic, it costs nothing, and

  // opt-out that silences a refusal is the thing contributors learn to reach for — the same

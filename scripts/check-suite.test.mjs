// POSTURE: RUNS NOWHERE, AND THAT TAKES A LOAD-BEARING GUARD OFFLINE. `test:check-suite` exists as
// a script and is EXCLUDED from the suite; it has no step under .github/workflows/ either. In
// agentvibe this is step 2 of 48 and blocks. Here it is the check that says whether the other
// checks are in the suite at all, and nothing runs it — so `auditSuite()`, which is called from no
// other place in this repository, currently enforces nothing. The full cost, the quoted failures
// and the ONE EVENT that ends the exclusion are written out in EXCLUDED['test:check-suite'] in
// scripts/lib/check-suite.js. Read that entry, not this header, before deciding anything.
//
// *This header read "POSTURE: BLOCKS. Wired into `npm run check` as `test:check-suite`, second in
// the suite" on arrival, then "BLOCKS, AND IS CURRENTLY RED" for the few hours it was a failing
// step. Both are superseded; the note below is why. — beeond, 2026-08-31.*
//
// *WHY IT DOES NOT PASS, AND WHY THE FIX IS UPSTREAM RATHER THAN HERE. This file
// arrived byte-identical from agentvibe and roughly a dozen of its cases name AGENTVIBE'S SCRIPTS
// as literals: `test:sandbox` and `lint:agents` as mutation subjects, `check:mc` as an EXCLUDED
// entry that must exist, the five delegating `&&` aliases in ALIASES, the nine steps the chain used
// to skip, the argv pins on `test:merge-gate` / `test:lenses` / `test:probe-readonly`, and the
// scale floors `rawRuns >= 40` and `files.length > 20`. beeond has none of those scripts. Those
// cases are not failing because beeond's suite is wrong; they are failing because they describe a
// different repository, which is the same finding the installer acted on when it refused to copy
// scripts/lib/check-suite.js.
//
// THE MACHINERY HALF IS REAL COVERAGE AND IT PASSES: the shell-operator scanner, the arithmetic and
// quoting cases, the ci.yml parser and its refusal shapes, the chain findings, and the runner's
// behaviour under failure, interruption and subset runs. Those are what keep beeond's ci.yml
// honest, and every one of them was checked against beeond's real workflow by hand on 2026-08-31:
// 11 parsed steps against 11 raw items, 9 run against 9, 2 uses against 2, zero unguarded steps,
// zero `continue-on-error` keys, zero STEPS without a counterpart, zero direct `node --test`.
//
// THE FIX IS TO ADAPT THIS FILE, NOT TO WEAKEN IT OR TO UNWIRE THE STEP. Repoint the mutation
// subjects at beeond's own step names and derive the scale floors from STEPS.length instead of
// typing them. Nothing below has been edited except this header.*
//
// scripts/check-suite.test.mjs — the drift guard for `npm run check`, and the mutation gate for
// the runner that replaced its `&&` chain.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS: the suite was thirty steps joined by `&&`. Step 21, `check:mc`, fails on
// any machine that has not run `bun install` in mission-control/, and `&&` stops there — so nine
// steps never ran, including every safety-hook test and `test:sandbox`, while the output reported
// one failure. The runner fixes the instance. This file fixes the class, in two halves:
//
//   THE DRIFT GUARD — a check:/test: script that exists in package.json but is reachable from
//   nothing in the suite fails here. A future script cannot be added and silently left out.
//
//   THE RUNNER'S BEHAVIOUR — that it keeps going after a failure, tallies honestly, exits
//   non-zero, and does not truncate. Every case CONSTRUCTS the condition in a fixture repo and
//   reads what came back, rather than asserting against the working tree, which would pass or
//   fail for reasons the test did not choose.
//
// WHAT IT ASSERTS, AND WHAT IT LEAVES OPEN:
//   ✓ the guard REFUSES a real package.json with a step removed from STEPS — proved by mutation,
//     not by a green run against a tree where nothing is wrong
//   ✓ the five delegating parents are EXCLUDED aliases and every link they hid is a STEP — this
//     line said the opposite until 2026-08-25 ("transitive reach counts, so check:ledger's three
//     tests are not duplicated into STEPS"), and reaching a script is not running it separately:
//     the parents were `&&` chains, so 18 links reported as 5 steps and the links after a failing
//     one never ran. Transitive reach is still proved, against a constructed graph
//   ✓ a STEP whose RESOLVED command carries any shell control operator is REFUSED — `&&`, `||`,
//     `;`, `|`, `&` and a newline — so the chain cannot return through package.json after being
//     taken out of STEPS, nor through a wrapper script one or more `npm run` hops away, and an
//     alias exemption is refused the moment one of its links leaves the suite.
//     *Superseded 2026-08-26: this line read "a STEP whose command carries `&&`", which is what the
//     guard checked. Four mutations walked past it — `;`, `||`, `|` and a one-hop wrapper, each
//     measured at ZERO findings — and `;` is the worst of them, because `bash -c 'false ; true'`
//     exits 0 and the failure leaves no red step at all.*
//   ✓ ci.yml is PARSED, and the three guarantees of the 2026-08-25 change are asserted against it:
//     every STEPS entry has a step there, every `run:` step carries `if: ${{ !cancelled() }}`, and
//     `continue-on-error` appears as a word in one comment and as a KEY nowhere. Each is proved by
//     mutation, and the parser is cross-checked against raw line counts so it cannot under-read the
//     file into vacuous green
//   ✓ the runner runs a step after an earlier one failed, and says so in the tally
//   ✓ ~200KB of step output survives to the caller through a pipe — the process.exit() defect
//   ✓ a ZERO-step run is refused, and --steps/--root are refused outright without the harness
//     variable. Both are new, and both are here because the runner shipped printing
//     "✓ check suite passed — every step ran." at exit 0 for `node scripts/run-checks.mjs
//     --steps ,` — a green floor from a process that ran nothing, reachable from `npm run check`
//     by appending arguments, in the one place a prompt-injected diff is modelled as steering
//     what the oracle reads
//   ✓ a passing SUBSET says it is a subset and does not print the whole-suite verdict
//   ✓ a real Ctrl+C — SIGINT to the process GROUP, not to the child alone — reaches the
//     INCOMPLETE verdict. It did not before: the parent took Node's default kill while spawnSync
//     had the event loop blocked, so the path the header promises was unreachable for the one
//     case that happens
//   ✓ deleting `lint:agents` from STEPS now fails. GOVERNED matched only check:/test:, so the
//     agent schema linter could leave the suite in silence — and every STEP is now checked for
//     being governed at all, which covers the next prefix rather than the three we thought of
//   ✗ nothing here can check that the pass/fail figures written into EXCLUDED['check:mc'] are
//     TRUE. A regex over the reason string used to pin them, kept passing after they stopped
//     reproducing, and so reported green on exactly the defect it sat next to. The citations are
//     checked instead — ci.yml, .claude/settings.json — because those resolve.
//   ✗ nothing here checks that a step ASSERTS anything. Wiring is not value: a step that exits 0
//     unconditionally passes this file and always will.
//   ✗ nothing here runs the real steps for real. The full-suite verdict IS covered, against a
//     fixture that stubs every STEPS name green — which proves the wording and the count, not the
//     checks. Running them for real is `npm run check` itself, and it takes minutes.
//     *Superseded 2026-08-25: this line said "the real 31 steps". STEPS held 31 only between
//     `test:check-suite` being added and `check:mc` being excluded; derive it, never recall it —
//     `node -e "console.log(require('./scripts/lib/check-suite.js').STEPS.length)"`.*
//     *Superseded 2026-08-26: the count was then written in as 30, twice, and went stale the same
//     way when collapsing the five `&&` aliases took STEPS to 43. It is not written here at all
//     now — the assertions derive it from STEPS, which is the only spelling that cannot rot.*

// CHECK. Each is proved by mutation, because a green run against the current file proves only that
// the current file is currently fine:
//
//   STEPS ⊆ ci.yml       `test:check-suite` itself "ran NOWHERE on a runner until 2026-08-25" —
//                        ci.yml says so in its own comment. It was step 2 of the suite with no CI
//                        step, and nothing reported it, because only EXCLUDED entries were ever
//                        checked against this file and no test iterated STEPS.
//   the `if:` guard      `if: ${{ !cancelled() }}` on every `run:` step IS the change. One step
//                        added without it, or one tidy-up that lifts the repetition into
//                        something clever, silently restores fail-fast for everything after it.
//   continue-on-error    ci.yml states "it appears nowhere in this file" as the reason a failure
//                        is still a failure. That sentence is the load-bearing half of the change

// these green while asserting nothing, which is this file's own recurring defect.

// ── Fixture POSITION is a variable to sweep, not a setting to pick ────────────────────────────
//
// TWO FINDINGS ON ONE DAY, EACH MASKED BY THE POSITION THAT REVEALED THE OTHER. That symmetry is
// why this is a harness and not a paragraph:
//
//   the FLUSH-job P0     appending it went red — but only because the case below it appends its own
//                        injection after, so the test's self-control caught its own instrument
//                        dying. Moving it to the FRONT is what surfaced the bypass.
//   the SECOND-job bypass  prepending it was CAUGHT on `main` at `steps=1` — the parser had
//                        collapsed and reported on a fragment of a 52-step file. APPENDING it is
//                        what shows the bypass: `steps=52`, silent.
//
// So neither position is the safe one, and "prepend your fixture" is half a technique. A CATCH FROM
// A COLLAPSED PARSE IS NOT A CATCH, and the tell is the denominator: this file has long insisted a
// negative result needs a control that must fire; this is the mirror — A POSITIVE RESULT NEEDS ITS
// DENOMINATOR READ. `sweepPositions` reads it, at every position, on every call.
//
// SCOPE, STATED NARROWLY ON PURPOSE. This covers ADDITIVE injections into the real ci.yml — a
// fragment that must CHOOSE where to go. There are exactly three such sites in this file and they
// are swept below. `CI.replace(...)` mutations of an existing line are NOT in scope: they do not
// choose a position, they inherit one. Calling this "every fixture-based finding in the repo" would
// be the same over-generalisation the harness exists to catch.

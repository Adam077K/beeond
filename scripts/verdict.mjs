// POSTURE: BLOCKS NOTHING HERE — ITS ONLY CALLER IS ABSENT. The exit codes are real and unchanged:
// `check` exits non-zero unless a committed verdict is bound to the exact diff being merged, exit 2
// means the subject could not be determined, and there is no exit path that lets an unreviewed diff
// through. What is missing is the caller: `bin/warroom`'s cmd_merge is what refuses on that
// non-zero, and beeond's bin/ holds init-from-template.sh, install-war-room.sh and install.js — no
// `warroom` launcher. Nothing reads this script's exit code, so nothing is gated by it.
//
// *Corrected for beeond 2026-08-31. This read "POSTURE: BLOCKS ... `bin/warroom`'s cmd_merge
// refuses on that non-zero", naming a file that does not exist in this repository. The same absence
// is why scripts/merge-gate.test.mjs is excluded from the suite with 44 of its 64 cases failing on
// ENOENT for that path.*
//
// scripts/verdict.mjs — bind a QA verdict to a diff, so the record cannot go stale.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// `warroom merge` merged into LOCAL main and never pushed. CI never ran, branch protection was
// never consulted, and the only "review" in the path was a `qa_verdict: PASS` string the change's
// own author wrote in their own session file. The remote could not reach this route at all.
//
// A gate needs something to check that the author cannot trivially restate. The thing that works
// is a verdict keyed to the CONTENT of the change:
//
//   subject = sha256( git diff <merge-base origin/main REF>..REF -- . ':(exclude,glob).qa/verdicts/*.json' )
//
// THE ANCHOR, AND WHY THIS ONE
// PR #77 keyed a verdict to a HEAD SHA. That anchor stops existing the instant the verdict is
// committed — recording the record moves HEAD, so the verdict is stale on arrival. The primitive
// was right; the anchor was wrong.
//
// A content subject that EXCLUDES the verdict RECORDS is stable across recording the verdict itself
// and changes the moment any reviewed byte changes. That is the property the whole design rests
// on, and `scripts/merge-gate.test.mjs` executes it rather than asserting it.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT CLAIM
// This is not a cryptographic signature. Anyone who can write the repo can write a verdict file.
// What the subject buys is that a verdict cannot be MOVED to a different diff and cannot SURVIVE
// an edit to the diff it approved — and, because `check` reads the verdict out of the committed
// tree, every verdict has a git author and a revert. Real unforgeability needs a signing key and
// a decision about who holds it. That decision has not been made, so it is not claimed here.
//
// USAGE
//   node scripts/verdict.mjs subject [--repo P] [--ref R] [--json]   # print the subject
//   node scripts/verdict.mjs record  [--repo P] [--ref R] [--json] --verdict PASS --by who
//                                    [--evidence t] [--run-id id] [--dry-run]
//   node scripts/verdict.mjs check   [--repo P] [--ref R] [--json]
//
// `record` writes the file; you then COMMIT it. `check` reads it back out of the ref's tree, so an
// uncommitted verdict does not count. `--dry-run` builds the same record and does not write it.
//
// AN UNKNOWN FLAG IS REFUSED, exit 2, nothing written. It used to be DROPPED: `arg()` searches argv
// for the names it is asked for and never looks at the rest, so a misspelling or a flag borrowed
// from another tool changed nothing and said nothing. Measured on `main` at 47dbbd6,
// `record --verdict PASS --by probe --dry-run` exited 0 and wrote a real record for the empty-diff
// subject — the operator typed a flag whose whole purpose was to prevent that. See FLAGS below.
//
// THESE THREE LINES ARE NO LONGER THE ONLY DESCRIPTION OF THE FLAG SURFACE, and that is why the
// list above is now complete: `--run-id` and `--evidence` were readable and undocumented here, so
// this block said five flags where the code read seven. usage() is generated from FLAGS.

/**
 * A BOUND ON GIT'S OUTPUT, AND IT MOVES THE CLIFF RATHER THAN REMOVING IT.
 *
 * `computeSubject()` hashes a WHOLE-BRANCH DIFF, so this call's output grows with the branch and
 * has no natural ceiling. It carried no `maxBuffer` at all, which meant Node's default of 1 MiB —
 * and `integration/design-layer` crossed it. Measured 2026-08-29 by bisecting this exact call across
 * the branch: `3b64a9a` returned normally at 1,041,526 bytes — under the 1,048,576 cap — and the very
 * next commit threw `ENOBUFS` at 1,050,273. Same args, same cwd, only this option differing.
 *
 * Do not quote a byte count for the CURRENT branch: it grows with every commit. Derive it —
 *   node scripts/verdict.mjs subject --repo . --ref HEAD --json     # prints subject, base and bytes
 *
 * *Superseded 2026-08-29: the pair above read "1,026,873 bytes at 3b64a9a" and "returns 1,100,001
 * bytes". Both were CHARACTER counts of a utf8-decoded string, labelled as bytes, and `maxBuffer` is
 * measured in BYTES — so the figure was compared against a cap in the wrong unit and sat 14,653 under
 * the true value. This repo's prose is full of multibyte punctuation, which is the whole of the gap.
 * The bisection landed on the right pair of commits either way, and the argument is unchanged.*
 *
 * WHY THIS IS AN INCIDENT AND NOT A NUISANCE. `verdict.mjs check` is on the BLOCKING path of
 * `.github/workflows/qa-lead-pass.yml`. While this call throws, no subject can be computed, so no
 * verdict can be recorded or checked, and the gate this repo calls sacred becomes UNSATISFIABLE on
 * exactly the long-lived branches that most need it. Ours was the first to cross 1 MiB. It will not
 * be the last.
 *
 * WHAT SAVED IT WAS RULE 10, NOT LUCK. `execFileSync` THROWS on overflow rather than returning a
 * short read, the catch below turns that into a `Refusal` (exit 2), and a refusal is a distinct
 * terminal value from a pass. So the failure was a BLOCKED merge and never a FORGED verdict: at no
 * point was a truncated diff hashed and presented as a subject. That property does not depend on
 * the number below, and it must survive any change to it.
 *
 * 64 MiB IS A BOUND, NOT A REMOVAL, and saying so is the point. A branch whose diff exceeds it
 * fails exactly as before — `ENOBUFS`, caught, refused — and it still never truncates. The value is
 * the higher of the two already in use: FIVE sync git call sites under `scripts/` set a bound, four
 * at 32 MiB (`ledger.mjs` x2, `evict-memory.mjs`, `lib/claim-append.js`) and one at 64
 * (`vendor-provenance.mjs`), and `.claude/hooks/schema-lint.js` sets 64 outside `scripts/`. Both 64s
 * read blob CONTENT, which is the closest thing here to what this call does. Re-derive rather than
 * trusting the list:
 *   grep -rn "execFileSync('git'" scripts/ .claude/hooks/ | grep -v '\.test\.'
 *
 * *Superseded 2026-08-29: this said "the SIX other sync git call sites ... which set 32-64 MiB" and
 * listed `lib/resolvers.js` among them. That is not a git call site — it is `spawnSync(binPath, argv)`
 * dispatching the EXTERNAL JUDGE, and its bound is `JUDGE_MAX_OUTPUT` = 8 MiB, outside the range the
 * same sentence quoted. So the enumeration justifying this choice miscounted by one and misclassified
 * the entry it added. The choice stands; the evidence offered for it did not, which is exactly the
 * class of defect this session spent the day removing elsewhere.*

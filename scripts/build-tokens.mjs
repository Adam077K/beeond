// POSTURE: BLOCKS. The drift check runs as an assertion in scripts/build-tokens.test.mjs, which
// `test:lenses` runs — a STEP of `npm run check` and a step of the CI workflow. `--check` below is
// the same comparison for a human at a terminal; it is deliberately NOT a named npm script, because
// a `check:*` name is a GOVERNED prefix that must be a suite STEP or an EXCLUDED entry, and an
// EXCLUDED script runs in no automated lane at all — the name would have cost an `irreversible`-tier
// edit to scripts/lib/check-suite.js and bought zero coverage.

//
// ── WHAT IS DERIVED, WHAT IS CARRIED, WHAT IS COMPUTED ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
//   TYPE      is DERIVED.   Sizes, line-heights and tracking are arithmetic over four seed numbers.
//                           No size is typed anywhere in this repository.
//   COLOUR    is CARRIED.   The hex values pass through unchanged from seeds.json. Nothing about a
//                           palette is generated here, and saying otherwise would be a lie about the
//                           artifact: `design/system/palette.md` is where colour is decided.
//   CONTRAST  is COMPUTED.  Every pair, every run, from the carried colours.
//
// ── WHY THIS GENERATES tokens.json RATHER THAN VALIDATING AN AUTHORED ONE ────────────────────────
//
// `docs/03-system-design/agents/DESIGNER.md` §7.5 lists `design/tokens/tokens.json` as AUTHORED —
// "the only hand-edited file in tokens/". This script deliberately diverges: tokens.json is
// GENERATED from an authored `seeds.json`, and seeds.json is the only hand-edited file.
//
// CONSTRAIN BY INSTRUMENT, NOT BY RULE. A rule can be violated; a generator cannot emit what its
// arithmetic cannot produce. With the ramp derived, a fractional step is INEXPRESSIBLE rather than
// forbidden — there is no keystroke that produces `12.5px`, because no seed value maps to one.
// `docs/03-system-design/DESIGN-CAPABILITY.md` §3.4 states the general form of this move, from Shape
// Up's fat marker: "the robust implementation bans via instrument, not via rule: a rule can be
// violated, a marker width cannot."
//
// The measured defect this closes, taken from mission-control on 2026-08-29: 0 type tokens, 93
// hand-written `text-[Npx]` values across 9 sizes against 1 scale utility, 44 of them fractional,
// and `leading-relaxed` (1.625) applied 27 times across 10-15px where the rule is a curve.
//
// ── EVERY DERIVATION IS SOURCED. NONE IS THIS SCRIPT'S INVENTION ─────────────────────────────────
//
// All four rules come from `docs/03-system-design/DESIGN-CAPABILITY.md` §7.1, which measured them
// against linear.app, stripe.com, vercel.com and play.grafana.org:
//
//   1. UI BAND BY ABSOLUTE INCREMENT. size(i) = base + i*increment. The adjacent ratio is exactly
//      1 + increment/size, which DECREASES monotonically by construction. A MODULAR SCALE HOLDS
//      ITS RATIO CONSTANT AND IS THE WRONG MODEL — it was falsified during that research and is
//      not to be reintroduced.
//   2. DISPLAY BAND DERIVED SEPARATELY, same way, larger increment, JOINED BY A JUMP AND NEVER
//      INTERPOLATED. Neither band is derived from the other.
//   3. LINE-HEIGHT IS A CURVE, peaking near 1.5-1.56 at 16-18px and reaching 1.0 at display sizes.
//   4. TRACKING IS MONOTONE WITH SIZE, positive below ~14px and increasingly negative above.
//
// ── THE MEASURED INCREMENTS ARE DELIBERATELY NOT WRITTEN DOWN HERE ───────────────────────────────
//
// Read them off the corpus instead. Verified to run, 2026-08-29, from the repository root:
//
//   for d in design/references/*/; do node -e "const j=require('./$d/measured.json');
//     const s=a=>((a||[]).slice(1).map((v,i)=>+(v-a[i]).toFixed(3)).join(' ')||'(none)');
//     console.log('$d', 'ui', s(j.type.bands.ui.sizes), 'display', s(j.type.bands.display.sizes))"; done
//
// Every refusal in this file already does exactly that: `citeUi()`, `citeDisplay()` and
// `citeBandWidths()` all go through `referenceIncrements()`, which reads design/references/ on
// each call and reports an unreadable reference rather than shrinking `n` in silence.
//
// > **Superseded 2026-08-29.** Rules 1 and 2 above carried a table of increments — "the arithmetic

// > (1 2 2 2 2 2 2) and play.grafana.org (2)", and "linear 6 8 16 16 · stripe 4 4 6 16 · vercel
// > 32 8". Against the committed corpus, exactly ONE of those seven sub-figures holds — vercel's
// > display `32 8`. Derived with the command above on 2026-08-29:
// >
// >     docs.stripe.com   ui 1 1                          display 5 3 8
// >     linear.app        ui 1 1 1 1 1 1                  display 2 4 8 16 16 8
// >     play.grafana.org  ui 0.6 1.4                      display 1.4 1.4 9.8
// >     stripe.com        ui 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2  display 16 8
// >     vercel.com        ui 2 2                          display 32 8
// >
// > **AND THE NUMBERS WERE NOT INVENTED — THEY ARE AN ACCURATE QUOTATION OF §7.1, WHICH IS THE

// > never by a line number — `grep -n '1 1 1 1 2 2 2' docs/03-system-design/DESIGN-CAPABILITY.md`.
// > It omits docs.stripe.com because that reference did not exist when it was written. So this is
// > not a typo and not a stale copy of the corpus: it is **the source document and this
// > repository's own measurements disagreeing**, with the header presenting the document's figures
// > under the word "measured". §15.16 of that same document already says its unanimity claim is
// > "FALSE as written", and `uiSplit()` below says so to every reader who trips a refusal. The
// > disagreement is left standing in DESIGN-CAPABILITY.md on purpose: reconciling it is a change to
// > the sourced research, not to a generator, and quietly editing a cited document to match code is
// > the worse of the two failures available here.
// >
// > **The provenance is the part worth keeping.** `referenceIncrements()` below already records
// > that this same table "WAS A HAND-WRITTEN CONSTANT AND IT WAS WRONG ON EVERY ENTRY". That fix
// > removed the constant from the REFUSAL PATH and left its twin here, seventy lines above it,
// > still asserted — so the file documented that the table was refuted and went on asserting it in

// > repository keeps finding. **The cure is not a corrected table.** Every SOURCE.yml carries
// > `expires: 2026-11-27`, so the corpus WILL be recaptured and a corrected constant rots on that
// > day. A command does not.
//
// THE SHAPE OF (3) AND (4) IS SOURCED; THE EXACT FUNCTION IS A FIT. Nothing in the corpus publishes
// a formula — §9.6 of the same document records that "every motion number in every design system
// traces to craft consensus, not measurement", and the typographic curves are no better evidenced.
// So the functions below are chosen to pass through the sourced landmarks and nothing more is
// claimed for them. EVERY CONSTANT LIVES IN seeds.json, never inline, so a disagreement with the
// fit is a one-line edit to an authored file rather than a code change.
//
// ── CONTRAST MATHS: MIRRORED, NOT IMPORTED, AND HERE IS THE MEASUREMENT ──────────────────────────
//
// `scripts/design-probe.mjs` exports `luminance`, `contrast` and `parseRgb`, and importing them
// would be the right move if the file existed. Measured 2026-08-29 in a worktree checked out at
// origin/main (4ddc5c6): `ls scripts/design-probe.mjs` -> No such file or directory. It is untracked
// work in another lane. An import of a file that is not on `main` fails `npm run check` on a fresh
// clone, so `luminance` and `contrast` below are byte-equivalent mirrors of that lane's, and
// `hexToRgb` is new because the probe reads `rgb()` strings out of a browser while seeds.json
// carries hex. WHEN design-probe.mjs LANDS, REPLACE THE MIRROR WITH AN IMPORT — the test file pins
// the two figures that make the swap safe.
//
// The contrast table is computed and never typed, and that is a correction to a dated defect rather
// than a preference. `mission-control/client/src/styles.css` says of its own figures: "re-measured
// on 2026-08-13 after review found every one of them wrong — by 0.06 to 0.3, in both directions ...
// do not carry a figure forward because it was in the comment." A generator cannot carry a figure
// forward.

// ── validation: the refusals that make a bad ramp inexpressible ──────────────────────────────────

/**
 * THE TWO POST-CONDITIONS, EXPORTED SO THEY CAN BE DRIVEN DIRECTLY — and the reason is a measured
 * gap, not tidiness. These follow from the validated inputs, so a mutation run that DELETES them
 * turns nothing red: measured 2026-08-29 across 18 mutations of this file, 17 were caught by a test
 * and the monotonicity one was not. That is exactly the shape of an assertion somebody deletes as
 * dead code. Pulled out as pure functions so a test can hand them the input that seeds.json cannot
 * express, which turns an uncontrolled assertion into a controlled one.
 *
 * WHY "no input exists that would trip it" IS AN ARGUMENT NOW AND WAS A GUESS THEN. That sentence
 * stood here and it was FALSE when written: `{base: 34, increment: 1, steps: 4}` tripped
 * `assertMonotoneRatios` — three lines, a perfectly ordinary ramp — because the check compared
 * ratios ROUNDED TO 3dp, and 1.029412 and 1.028571 both read 1.029. The claim was not merely
 * unproven; the mutation run that produced it could not have found the counterexample either,
 * because a mutation run explores edits to the code and this was an untried INPUT.
 *
 * The comparison is exact as of the same day (see `adjacentRatiosExact`), and the claim now rests
 * on arithmetic rather than on a survey: for a constant increment d, ratio(i) = 1 + d/s(i), and
 * s(i) strictly increases, so the ratios strictly DECREASE — **in the reals, for every base and
 * every d > 0**.
 *
 * IN float64 THAT IS FALSE ABOVE A BOUND, AND SAYING "for every base" WAS THE SAME CLASS OF ERROR
 * AS THE 3dp ROUNDING IT REPLACED — a claim about numbers that ignored how they are represented,
 * two corrections in a row. `1 + d/s` rounds to exactly 1.0 once `d/s` falls below 2^-53, and
 * `validateSeeds` puts no upper bound on the base. Found by sweep, not by reading, 2026-08-29:
 *
 *   base 11         ratios 1.0909090909090908 1.0833333333333333 1.0769230769230769   decreasing
 *   base 10,000,000 ratios 1.0000001 1.00000009999999 1.00000009999998               decreasing
 *   base 67,114,654 ratios strictly decreasing                                       decreasing
 *   base 67,114,655 ratios 1.0000000148998753 1.0000000148998751 1.0000000148998751  TIE -> exit 2
 *
 * So the honest statement is: the ratios strictly decrease **for every base a font size can take**,
 * and the smallest base at which float64 ties, for increment 1 and 4 steps, is **67,114,655 px** —
 * roughly 8,700 times the width of an 8K display. No accepted seeds file that describes type can
 * reach the refusal.
 *
 * THAT FIGURE IS FROM AN EXHAUSTIVE SCAN OF EVERY INTEGER BASE BELOW IT, NOT FROM A SWEEP, and the
 * distinction earned its place: the first report of this gave 69,200,000 from a stepped sweep, and
 * a bisection to refine it returned 89,013,671 — higher than the value it was refining. Bisection
 * is invalid here because tying is NOT monotonic in the base: 69,100,000 does not tie and
 * 69,200,000 does. Three plausible numbers, two of them wrong, for a property that admits a
 * definite answer. Re-derive rather than trusting the constant:
 *   node -e "for(let b=2;b<7e7;b++){const x=(b+1)/b,y=(b+2)/(b+1),z=(b+3)/(b+2);
 *            if(!(x>y&&y>z)){console.log(b);break}}"
 *
 * NOTE WHAT IS AND IS NOT WRONG AT THAT BASE. The refusal there is CORRECT, not a false message:
 * the float64 ratios genuinely do tie, so the tripwire reports what it actually sees. What was
 * wrong is only the claim that no input could reach it. The base is deliberately left unbounded —
 * adding a ceiling would be a new refusal on an input nobody has, and the bound is more useful
 * written down than enforced.
 *
 * They are still not dead code. They are tripwires over `band()`: if a future edit makes it emit a
 * fractional size or a ramp that holds its ratio constant, these are what say so.

 * THE ONE GRAMMAR A FONT-FAMILY STACK MEMBER MAY HAVE, and it is an ALLOW-LIST on purpose.
 *
 * `renderCss` interpolates the family straight into a declaration inside `@theme { … }`, and CSS
 * has no escaping there — a value is copied to the sink verbatim. Measured 2026-08-29 against the
 * committed seeds with `type.family.sans` set to
 * `x, sans-serif} :root{--color-danger:#00ff00} a{content:"`:
 * the previous check (`typeof v === 'string' && v.trim().length > 0`) ACCEPTED it, the `}` closed
 * `@theme` on its own line, **31 of the 32 emitted declarations landed outside the block**, an
 * attacker-chosen `--color-danger` was live, and the final brace depth was **0** — so the file
 * still parses and the whole generated design system silently stops applying.
 *
 * A BALANCED FILE IS THE FAILURE MODE, WHICH IS WHY "it parses" PROVES NOTHING and why the drift
 * check cannot see this: `drift()` compares the committed output to a fresh generation from the
 * SAME seeds, so poisoned seeds produce a poisoned file the comparison calls correct. The trust
 * boundary is seeds.json — this refusal — not the renderer and not the extractor that suggests a
 * value for a human to paste.
 *
 * TWO CORRECTIONS OVERSHOT IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS BEFORE THIS SHAPE, and both are worth keeping.
 *
 * A BLANKET DENY-LIST WAS THE FIRST DESIGN AND IT REFUSED THIS REPO'S OWN SEEDS. Refusing every
 * one of ``; { } / * " ' \`` and newline refuses `'Segoe UI'`, `'SF Mono'`, `'JetBrains Mono'` and
 * `'Fira Code'` — four members of the committed stacks, and the CSS idiom for any family name
 * carrying a space. A quoted string is not the danger: a `}` inside a CSS string does not close a
 * block. An UNTERMINATED or nested quote is.
 *
 * THE ALLOW-LIST THAT REPLACED IT WAS ASCII-ONLY, AND THAT WAS THE OPPOSITE MISTAKE. The quoted
 * branch read `'[A-Za-z0-9 _-]+'`, so it refused valid CSS — measured 2026-08-29:
 *
 *   REFUSED   "微软雅黑", sans-serif            REFUSED   "맑은 고딕", sans-serif
 *   REFUSED   "ヒラギノ角ゴ ProN", sans-serif     REFUSED   "Åkzidenz Grotesk", sans-serif
 *   REFUSED   微软雅黑, sans-serif              <- the UNQUOTED branch had it too
 *
 * The safety argument above never asked for that: the dangerous characters are the ones that end
 * the string or escape out of it, and **a non-ASCII letter is neither**. Latent rather than live —
 * the committed seeds are ASCII — but `build-tokens --check` rides `test:lenses`, a CI step, so
 * the first CJK or accented family would have turned the build red. For a design-token generator
 * that is an ordinary thing to add.
 *
 * So: deny-list too broad, then allow-list too narrow. The shape that is neither is a deny-list
 * SCOPED TO THE QUOTED BRANCH, and Unicode letters admitted in the unquoted one.
 *
 * Admits exactly two shapes, and nothing reaches the sink that is not one of them:
 *   · a quoted name — `'Segoe UI'`, `"SF Mono"`, `"微软雅黑"` — closed, and containing none of
 *     `"` `'` `\` or a control character. Everything else may live inside it, because a CSS string
 *     is a string: `}`, `;` and `/*` inside one close nothing and start nothing.
 *   · unquoted identifiers — `ui-sans-serif`, `-apple-system`, `Segoe UI`, `微软雅黑` — letters,
 *     marks and digits of ANY script plus `_` and `-`, space-separated, with an optional leading
 *     `-`. Unquoted values have no string to protect them, so this branch stays an allow-list.
 *
 * BIDI AND JOINING MARKS ARE DELIBERATELY NOT REFUSED. U+061C, U+200E and U+200F appear in
 * ordinary Arabic and Hebrew text, and refusing them to pre-empt a display-spoofing worry nobody
 * has raised would recreate exactly the defect above, one script over. C0/C1 controls and DEL are
 * refused because they are not text.

 * was ACCEPTED, exit 0, four files written. One field into `renderCss`'s sink guarded and its

 *   renderCss         `  --color-${name}: ${hex};`    a CSS custom-property ident, inside @theme
 *   renderTs          `  '${name}': '${hex}',`        a SINGLE-QUOTED TypeScript string key
 *   renderJson        `color[name] = …`               a JavaScript object key
 *   renderContrastMd  `| \`${name}\` | … |`           a cell of a markdown TABLE
 *
 * Both payloads were reproduced verbatim on 2026-08-29 from a seeds file this generator ACCEPTED,
 * and the second is CODE EXECUTION rather than a spoiled stylesheet — design/tokens/tokens.ts is
 * imported by the app build:
 *
 *   name  a: b; } :root{ --color-text:#ff0000 } @media all { --z
 *     ->  --color-a: b; } :root{ --color-text:#ff0000 } @media all { --z: #ff0000;
 *         @theme is closed and :root reopened carrying an attacker-chosen --color-text.
 *
 *   name  x': String(globalThis.__PWNED = 'code-executed') //
 *     ->  'x': String(globalThis.__PWNED = 'code-executed') //': '#ff0000',
 *         evaluating the generated object literal sets globalThis.__PWNED. Confirmed by EXECUTION.
 *
 * `drift()` CANNOT SEE EITHER, for the reason FAMILY_MEMBER already states about its own payload:
 * `--check` compares the committed output against a fresh generation from the SAME seeds, so
 * poisoned seeds yield a poisoned file the comparison calls correct. seeds.json is the trust
 * boundary. A BALANCED FILE IS THE FAILURE MODE here too.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS AN ALLOW-LIST WITH NO QUOTED BRANCH. FAMILY_MEMBER admits two shapes because CSS
 * gives a family name a quoted form, and inside a CSS string `}` and `;` are inert. A colour name
 * has NO quoted form at any of its four sinks — `--color-"x"` is not a custom property — so the
 * only shape available to it is the unquoted one. This is FAMILY_MEMBER's unquoted branch with the
 * space dropped: a space is legal inside a quoted family name and is not a CSS ident code point.
 *
 * NON-ASCII LETTERS ARE ADMITTED, DELIBERATELY, AND THE OPPOSITE DECISION HAS ALREADY BEEN MADE
 * ONCE IN THIS FILE AND WAS WRONG. CSS Syntax Level 3 §4.2 defines an ident code point as "a
 * letter, a digit, U+005F LOW LINE (_), U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS (-), or a non-ASCII code point", so
 * `--color-ミッド` is valid CSS; a TS string key and a markdown cell take any letter too. The
 * ASCII-only allow-list FAMILY_MEMBER once carried refused 微软雅黑, 맑은 고딕 and Åkzidenz
 * Grotesk — all valid CSS — and a palette nameable in one script and unnameable in another is that
 * same defect one field over.
 *
 * AND IT IS STILL NARROWER THAN CSS ALLOWS, on purpose. CSS would take U+00A0 and every other
 * non-ASCII code point, including invisible ones. This grammar takes only letters, marks and
 * digits of any script plus `_` and `-`, so a space, a no-break space and a zero-width joiner are
 * refused — the same line FAMILY_MEMBER's unquoted branch draws, at no cost to any palette.

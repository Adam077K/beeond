#!/usr/bin/env node
// POSTURE: LIBRARY + ENTRY POINT. The blocking assertion is in `scripts/gates.test.mjs`, which
// runs as `npm run test:playbooks` — a STEP of `npm run check` with its own step in
// `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. This file is where the predicate lives so it has an
// implementation rather than living only inside a test, and it is runnable by hand
// (`npm run gates`) so a contributor can see the findings without running the suite. That is the
// same arrangement `scripts/lib/check-suite.js` documents for `check:ci-chains`, and it is
// deliberate: ONE place computes the answer, one step fails the build on it.
//
// scripts/check-gates.mjs — make a playbook's `gate:` resolve to something, and make its
// triggers reach a command that exists.
//
// ── THE TWO DEFECTS THIS CLOSES, both measured at 244e8db on 2026-08-26 ──────────────────────
//
// 1. `gate:` WAS A SPELLING ALLOWLIST. `.claude/hooks/schema-lint.js` refused any `gate:` value
//    outside a four-name array and that was the whole mechanism. The three names in use appear
//    seven times across the six playbooks; grepping them under `scripts/` and
//    `.claude/workflows/` returns the array and two test fixtures. Nothing executed. A stage
//    could declare `gate: qa-verdict`, exit having run nothing, and every check stayed green.
//
// 2. `triggers:` WAS DECORATION. One playbook of six carried the key — `ship-feature`, as
//    `["/build", "/fix"]` — and `grep -rn triggers scripts .claude` found no reader anywhere.
//    It also disagreed with the tree it described: `.claude/commands/ship.md` declares
//    `playbook: ship-feature` in its frontmatter and `/ship` was not in that list. Two
//    statements about one relation, disagreeing, with nothing to notice.
//
// The remedy for both is the same and it is not "add a key": a reference is worth having only
// when something fails on it. Every finding below fails `npm run check`.
//
// ── WHY THE GATE KINDS ARE DATA ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// `founder-approval` and `outbound-approval` are human stops. They are not scripts and must not
// be faked into one — a process that reports PASS for "a human approved" has invented the
// approval. But "a human must approve" and "nothing implements this" were the same string in the
// same array, so the two were indistinguishable to any reader and to every checker. `kind:` in
// `.claude/gates.yml` makes them different values, and this file refuses a `human` gate that
// carries a `run:`.
//
// Resolving a human gate returns `unresolved`, never `pass`. That is Rule 10 in CLAUDE.md — a
// resolver never passes what it could not check — and `scripts/gates.test.mjs` pins it.
//
// ── USAGE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//   node scripts/check-gates.mjs                       # every finding; exit 1 if any
//   node scripts/check-gates.mjs check --json
//   node scripts/check-gates.mjs resolve qa-verdict    # actually run the gate
//   node scripts/check-gates.mjs resolve qa-verdict -- --ref HEAD
//
// The example above named `--ref origin/main...HEAD` and returned exit 3 / unresolved when run
// verbatim: `verdict.mjs --ref` takes a SINGLE revision and computes merge-base(origin/main, ref)
// itself, so a range reaches git as an object name and is refused. A copy-pasteable instruction
// that does not run is worse than none. For a ref that is not checked out, take verdictRef.ref
// from `node scripts/run-gate.mjs --json` — it is sha-pinned, or null with the reason why.
//
// `resolve` exit codes, which are NOT the exit codes of the command it ran:
//   0  pass         the gate's command exited 0
//   1  fail         the gate's command exited 1
//   3  unresolved   a human stop, a spawn failure, a signal, or any other exit code
//
// Three is a distinct code on purpose. Folding `unresolved` into `fail` would be safe and folding
// it into `pass` would not, but a caller that cannot tell them apart cannot report which happened,
// and "the gate said no" and "the gate could not be asked" take different remedies.

// POSTURE: BLOCKS. Wired to .github/workflows/ci.yml through `npm run test:playbooks`, which
// runs this file alongside scripts/playbooks.test.mjs. It rides that step rather than taking one
// of its own on purpose: `scripts/lib/check-suite.js` owns the step list and is `irreversible`
// tier, and the subject here — what a playbook's `gate:` and `triggers:` resolve to — is a
// playbook property. `npm run gates` is the same predicate as a human-readable entry point, the
// arrangement check-suite.js documents for `check:ci-chains`.
//
// scripts/gates.test.mjs — every rule tested by constructing the input that DEFEATS it.
//
// WHY EACH FAILURE IS BUILT RATHER THAN ASSUMED
// The defect this whole change closes is a reference that resolves to nothing while everything
// reports green: `gate: qa-verdict` was checked against a four-name array and executed by no one,
// and `triggers:` was read by nothing at all. Replacing one unchecked reference with another
// would be the same defect in a new spelling. So every finding below is produced by a fixture
// that would have passed before the rule existed, and the GOOD fixture is asserted clean first,
// so a failure below is the rule firing and not the fixture being broken.
//
// The fixtures are VALUES, not files. wiringFindings() is pure for this reason: writing a fixture
// into `.claude/playbooks/` to test a checker that reads `.claude/playbooks/` makes the test
// unrunnable in parallel and, under the armed sandbox, sometimes unrunnable at all.
//
// WHY `test:playbooks` CARRIES `--test-concurrency=1`, measured here on 2026-08-26.
// `scripts/playbooks.test.mjs` lints by WRITING `.claude/playbooks/fixture.yml` and unlinking it.
// Node runs `--test` files concurrently by default, so the first run of the two together threw
// `ENOENT ... .claude/playbooks/fixture.yml` out of loadPlaybooks() here — this file read the
// directory while the other file was mid-write. The hazard is that shared directory, not this
// test: any future reader of `.claude/playbooks/` in a concurrent file meets it again, and the
// durable fix is a fixture that does not live in the tree under test. Serialising the two files
// is the narrow fix; it is named here so the next person does not rediscover it as a flake.

// Everything above checks the SHAPE of the wiring. Shape is not enough, and a reviewer proved it:
// repoint `qa-verdict`'s `run:` at `node scripts/lib/claims.js` — a library that exits 0 — and every
// check in this file still passes, `npm run gates` prints "✓ gate and trigger wiring resolves", and
// `resolve qa-verdict` reports PASS having verified nothing. The string
// `node scripts/verdict.mjs check` appeared only in the GOOD() fixture above, which is a VALUE and
// not the shipped file, so nothing connected the two.
//
// That is this PR's own defect class arriving one layer down, in the file written to end it: a
// one-line edit to a `lite`-tier data file makes the gate report PASS while enforcing nothing.
//
// The blast radius is bounded and that is why the fix is a pin rather than a redesign:
// `.github/workflows/qa-lead-pass.yml` calls `verdict.mjs check --json` DIRECTLY and never reads
// `gates.yml`, so this cannot disarm CI. What it can do is mislead a person running `resolve` by
// hand, which `.claude/commands/review.md` tells them to do.
//
// Pinned as exact strings on purpose. Adding a flag to the command that resolves the binding gate
// is precisely the change that should require editing a test and explaining itself.
//
// ── WHAT THESE TWO CONSTANTS DO NOT CHECK, STATED SO IT IS A TRADE AND NOT AN IMPLIED CLOSURE ──
//
// NOTHING HERE CHECKS THAT THESE PAIRS ARE THE RIGHT PAIRS. They check that the shipped tree still
// says what this file says it says. Change both together, in one commit, and every check passes.
//
// Measured on this tree, both halves:
//
//   swap validate-a-market/judge from `founder-approval` to `qa-verdict` and update SHIPPED_GATES
//     -> npm run gates 0 · test:playbooks 0 · lint:agents 0
//        A founder sign-off has become an exit code, and nothing in the repository noticed.
//   repoint qa-verdict's `run:` at `node scripts/classify.mjs` and update SHIPPED_RUN
//     -> test:playbooks 0
//        The binding gate now resolves by running the tier classifier.
//
// SO THE PIN CONVERTS A ONE-LINE `lite` EDIT INTO A TWO-FILE EDIT, AND THAT IS ALL IT DOES. It is
// still the right trade, and the reason is that the alternative regresses one level up: a third
// declaration of the same fact — a floor entry, a second constant, a schema — can be changed in
// the same commit as the other two, so it moves the coincidence rather than removing it. Every
// authority that lives inside the repo has this property; only something outside it does not.
//
// What actually catches this is a human reading the diff, and the pin is what makes that possible:
// a gate change can no longer arrive as one plausible line in a data file. It arrives as a test
// edit that says, in the diff, that someone decided a founder no longer approves this. That is a
// weaker guarantee than the ones above it and it is deliberately not described as equivalent.

// ── THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS SCAN REFUSED ANY UNQUOTED `#`, AND THAT WAS WRONG ─────────────
//
// It fired on inputs nothing eats. Executed against PyYAML — a real YAML implementation, not our
// reading of the spec — one row per shape, `parseYamlSubset` beside it:
//
//   PLAIN SCALARS — six for six, our parser IS spec-conformant:
//     k: alpha PR #115, bravo        both -> "alpha PR"                 a comment, correctly
//     k: alpha#beta gamma            both -> "alpha#beta gamma"         INTACT
//     k: C# and F# notes             both -> "C# and F# notes"          INTACT
//     k: https://x/doc#approval      both -> "https://x/doc#approval"   INTACT
//     k: done  # a real comment      both -> "done"                     a comment, correctly
//     k: "alpha PR #115, bravo"      both -> intact                     quoting works
//
//   BLOCK SCALARS — AND HERE THEY DISAGREE, which is the shape F12 actually had:
//     k: >  / alpha PR #115, bravo   PyYAML -> "alpha PR #115, bravo …"  content, per spec
//                                    ours   -> "alpha PR …"              EATEN
//     k: |  / alpha PR #115, bravo   PyYAML -> keeps it · ours -> eats it
//
// So the rule is NOT "any unquoted #", and it is not "the YAML rule" either — inside a block
// scalar our parser is not the YAML rule. The line that has zero false positives BY CONSTRUCTION
// is: a whitespace-preceded, unquoted `#` on a BLOCK SCALAR continuation line. Inside a block
// scalar YAML says there is no such thing as a comment, so anything our parser strips there is
// content the author wrote and lost. On a plain-scalar line, `key: value  # note` is a real
// comment that both parsers agree on, nothing is lost, and refusing it was a house-style rule
// wearing a correctness message — with an impossible remedy attached, since `kind: "command"  #
// note` was refused too and quoting is what the message told you to do.

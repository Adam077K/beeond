/**
 * run-checks.mjs — `npm run check`. Runs EVERY step, reports EVERY failure.
 *
 * POSTURE: BLOCKS locally — it exits non-zero when any step fails, and it is the entry point
 * contributors invoke by hand. CI (.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs the same scripts individually
 * rather than through this file, on purpose: one step per check, so a red build names which ones.
 *
 * *Corrected for beeond 2026-08-31. This read "This is the deterministic floor
 * `.claude/workflows/qa.js` runs as its ORACLE before any review agent is dispatched." That is
 * agentvibe's arrangement and it is NOT true here: beeond's .claude/workflows/qa.js contains no
 * reference to `npm run check` or to this file — `grep -n 'npm run check' .claude/workflows/qa.js`
 * returns nothing. Nothing in beeond gates on this runner. It is worth being exact about, because
 * "the gate's own oracle" is the reason several comments in this tree give for why a thing matters,
 * and here that reason does not yet apply.*
 *
 * WHY IT REPLACED A ONE-LINE `&&` CHAIN. The chain stopped at the first failure. `check:mc` sat at
 * step 21 of 30 and fails on any machine without `bun install` in mission-control/, so nine steps
 * after it — every safety-hook test, the gate's own tests, and `test:sandbox` — had not run for as
 * long as that was true, while the output showed exactly one failure. `check:mc` has since left the
 * suite for an unrelated reason: the armed sandbox denies it a loopback bind(), wherever it runs.
 * *Superseded 2026-08-25: this said "as a child process", which was the belief at the time and is
 * refuted by a matched pair — standalone fails too, once `sandbox.excludedCommands` was reverted.*
 * The full argument, and that one, are in scripts/lib/check-suite.js, which owns the step list.
 *
 * ── WHAT THE OUTPUT PROMISES ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The reader of this output is an agent deciding whether a diff proceeds. It must not be able to
 * mistake a partial run for a clean one, so:
 *
 *   · every step runs, whatever the ones before it did
 *   · each step's own stdout and stderr go straight to this process's, unbuffered and untruncated
 *     (stdio: 'inherit' — the child writes to the same file descriptor)
 *   · the summary names every failing step, and the FAILED verdict is printed BEFORE the tally,
 *     with no ✓ anywhere above it. Passing steps are marked `·`, not `✓`, for the same reason
 *   · an interrupted run prints INCOMPLETE and names the steps that never started, rather than
 *     ending silently
 *   · a run of a SUBSET of the suite says so in its banner and in its verdict, and never claims
 *     "every step ran" — only a run of the whole declared list may say that
 *   · a run of ZERO steps is REFUSED. It is the maximal partial run, and it used to print the
 *     clean verdict at exit 0
 *
 * ── THE SUBSET FLAGS ARE A GATE, NOT A CONVENTION ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `--steps` and `--root` exist for scripts/check-suite.test.mjs, which has to construct a failing
 * suite in a fixture repo to prove this runner reports one. A comment calling them "test-only"
 * stopped nobody: they were read straight off `process.argv` with no guard, and `npm run check`
 * forwards anything after `--` to this script. `--steps ,` resolved to the empty list, which the
 * loop below iterated zero times and the summary then reported as
 *
 *     Tally: 0 of 0 passed · 0 failed · 0.0s
 *     ✓ check suite passed — every step ran.          exit 0
 *
 * — an authentic green floor, real exit code and all, from a process that ran no check at all.
 * That output is not read by a human: .claude/workflows/qa.js runs `npm run check` as its ORACLE
 * and dispatches an agent to read the result, and qa.js names prompt injection from the diff under
 * review as the way that agent gets subverted. A diff that talks the oracle into appending
 * `-- --steps ,` is the whole attack. So the flags now require CHECK_SUITE_TEST_HARNESS=1 in the
 * environment, and argv carrying them without it is a hard failure rather than an ignored
 * argument — an argument string alone can no longer decide how much of the floor runs. The empty
 * list is refused independently, because a guard whose only defence is another guard is one guard.
 *
 * NO TIMEOUT, deliberately. `check:ledger` takes 45-70s and `check:mc` took about three minutes
 * while it was still a step, looking hung throughout. A timeout would turn a slow check into a
 * flaky one, and the slowest steps here are the ones whose failure matters most.
 *
 * NO `process.exit()` ON ANY PATH THAT HAS RUN A STEP, deliberately. It does not flush an async
 * pipe write: a sibling branch just fixed six scripts that printed a large payload and then
 * exited, cutting stdout at exactly 65536 bytes with status 0. This runner emits more output than
 * any of them. It sets `process.exitCode` and lets the process end on its own.
 * scripts/check-suite.test.mjs pins that with a step that prints ~200KB.
 *   THE ONE EXCEPTION is `refuse()` below, which runs before any child has been spawned and whose
 *   only output went through `writeOut` — `fs.writeSync`, which has already handed every byte to
 *   the OS by the time it returns, EAGAIN retries included. The truncation hazard is a property of
 *   async writes and does not reach that path. It has its own pipe test, for the same reason.
 *
 * AND ITS OWN LINES GO OUT SYNCHRONOUSLY, for a second reason that is easy to miss. The children
 * write straight to fd 1 (stdio: 'inherit'), and `spawnSync` blocks the event loop — so a banner
 * queued through `process.stdout.write` while stdout is a PIPE can be flushed only after the child
 * it introduces has already finished writing. Small writes usually slip through synchronously and
 * the ordering looks fine, which is exactly how this would be missed until a run under load put a
 * failing step's output under the wrong banner. `writeOut` uses `fs.writeSync` so the ordering is
 * not left to the pipe buffer.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npm run check                       # the suite, and the only spelling a contributor needs
 *   node scripts/run-checks.mjs         # identical
 *
 *   CHECK_SUITE_TEST_HARNESS=1 node scripts/run-checks.mjs --root DIR --steps a,b,c
 *     Test-only, and gated on that variable rather than merely documented as test-only — see
 *     "THE SUBSET FLAGS ARE A GATE, NOT A CONVENTION" below.

//
// THE COST, stated because it is a real one: a step that IGNORES SIGINT now keeps this process

//
// *Corrected for beeond 2026-08-31. This read "POSTURE: BLOCKS. Wired to .github/workflows/ci.yml
// via `npm run test:ledger`". Disposition and falsifying command in scripts/lib/check-suite.js's EXCLUDED, and that entry carries the measurement and the exact command that would falsify it.*
//
// scripts/ledger.test.mjs — the resolvers, and the invariant that holds the ledger up.
//
// THE INVARIANT UNDER TEST: no resolver returns `pass` when it could not check.
//
// Every "returns unresolved" case below is a case where a fail-open resolver would have
// returned pass and the build would have gone green over an unverified claim. That is not
// hypothetical here: `.claude/hooks/schema-lint.js` still contains `catch { LIVE_SKILLS =
// null }`, which silently disables its own skill check whenever the manifest will not
// parse, and fabrications survived eight weeks of green builds behind exactly that shape.
//
// The network is never touched. `fetchImpl` is injected, so a dead DNS entry, a 404, a
// moved quote and a timeout are all constructed rather than hoped for — the Phase 2
// lesson: a guard verified only on the happy path is a guard whose failure was never built.

// THE WRITE SIDE OF THE SAME LEDGER, registered here on purpose.
//
// scripts/claim-append.test.mjs covers the only path that PUTS a claim in this ledger —
// the MCP grant `sourcer` holds. Importing it means `npm run test:ledger` runs both, so
// the producer and the resolvers that judge it are checked by one command and cannot
// drift apart between two. It is an import rather than a new `npm run` step because
// package.json and scripts/lib/check-suite.js are owned by another lane this week, and a
// test waiting on a step to be added is a test that is not running.

// ── locate, over BOTH scopes ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The first version of this test asserted `/^docs\/06-codebase\/ledger-canary\.md:\d+$/`.

// sample — and `locate` was printing `~/.warroom/ledger/global.yml:0` for all four of
// them, a number nobody measured, inside the change whose whole argument is against
// exactly that. The assertion underneath it was the right one; it was aimed at the only
// ground where it already held.
//
// That is not the empty-sample defect. The sample was not empty — it was drawn entirely
// from the region where the property is true. Same family as the selector defect in
// views.test.tsx (rows picked by the content under test); different mechanism.
//
// So: the global ledger is INJECTED, via WARROOM_GLOBAL_LEDGER.
//
// THE REAL LEDGER CANNOT SERVE THIS TEST, in either direction. Its contents differ per
// machine, so there is no known line to expect — and on a runner with no
// ~/.warroom/ledger/global.yml there are no global claims at all. Measured:
// `HOME=<empty> ledger locate` lists 33 claims where this machine lists 37. A test that
// exercised globals against the real file would iterate an empty set in CI and pass. That
// is the empty-sample defect, and it would have landed inside the fix for the sampling
// defect — a fourth variant of the same family, in the same change.
//
// $HOME would also have worked, and is not what this uses: eventsPath() resolves through
// os.homedir() too, so moving HOME to reach the ledger silently moves the run log with it.
// One knob, one thing.

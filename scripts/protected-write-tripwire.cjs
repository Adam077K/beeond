// POSTURE: BLOCKS in CI, for every `node --test` step of `npm run check` — FOUR of the seven steps
// in .github/workflows/ci.yml (test:build-tokens, test:design-lib, test:design-probe,
// test:extract-reference), each of which invokes its npm script and therefore carries the
// `--require` preload. Derive that figure with the command below rather than trusting it; a first
// draft of this line said three and was wrong by one, which is what the command is for. It does NOT block a binding QA gate here, because beeond has no gate that
// runs `npm run check` as an oracle; that half of agentvibe's posture is not true in this
// repository and is deliberately not claimed.
//
// AND NOTHING CHECKS THE WIRING RIGHT NOW. `scripts/protected-write.test.mjs` is what asserted that
// every reachable `node --test` step preloads this file, and it is EXCLUDED — see
// EXCLUDED['test:protected-write'] in scripts/lib/check-suite.js. This guard still FIRES; what is
// unwatched is whether the next test script added to package.json is put behind it. Until that
// exclusion is lifted, the preload is a convention a reviewer has to remember, not a checked fact.
//
// Derive the count rather than trusting this comment — the suite is STEPS in
// scripts/lib/check-suite.js, and the rule is "reachable from STEPS, runs `node --test`":
//
//   node -e "const{STEPS,reachable}=require('./scripts/lib/check-suite.js');
//     const p=JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('package.json','utf8')).scripts;
//     const t=[...reachable(p,STEPS)].filter(n=>/\bnode\b[^&|]*--test\b/.test(p[n]));
//     console.log(t.length, t.filter(n=>p[n].includes('protected-write-tripwire')).length)"
//
// scripts/protected-write-tripwire.cjs — a test may not write where the armed sandbox refuses.
//
// ── WHERE IT ACTUALLY BINDS, counted rather than assumed (2026-08-24) ────────────────────────
//   • THE GATE — .claude/workflows/qa.js names `npm run check` as the oracle that BLOCKs before
//     any panel agent is dispatched, and `test:protected-write` is first in that chain. This is
//     the environment the defect lived in, so this is the one that matters.
//   • CI — .github/workflows/ci.yml invokes 16 of the 26 by name via `npm run`, and those carry
//     the preload. Re-counted 2026-08-24 when the suite moved from an `&&` chain to
//     scripts/run-checks.mjs; the previous reading of 14 of 25 was taken before `test:pre-tool-use`
//     was wired into ci.yml the same day, and before `test:check-suite` existed.
//   • NOT ci.yml for `test:check-suite`, the suite's own drift guard — adding it edits a workflow
//     file, which is `irreversible` tier. Same known gap, same reason, as the two below.
//   • NOT ci.yml's "Gate logic tests" step, which runs
//     `node --test .claude/workflows/lib/gate-logic.test.mjs` DIRECTLY rather than through
//     `test:gate`. That script carries the preload and CI does not use it, so that one file is
//     run unpreloaded on a runner. A KNOWN GAP, left open deliberately: closing it edits a
//     workflow file, which takes a test fix from `full` to `irreversible` tier and puts a
//     founder sign-off in front of it. Queued for the irreversible follow-up.
//   • NOT CI for this file's own assertions either — `test:protected-write` is not named in
//     ci.yml, so the wiring check runs in the gate and locally, not on a runner.
//
// WHAT WENT WRONG, AND WHY A COMMENT WOULD NOT HAVE CAUGHT IT. Two tests in `npm run check`
// built their fixtures inside .claude/agents/ and .claude/hooks/. Arming the OS sandbox (#94)
// made those directories write-denied in the session the binding QA gate runs in — arming it
// protects them precisely BECAUSE writing there disarms the harness. So `npm run check`, which
// is the gate's own oracle, became unpassable in the only place it runs, and the gate BLOCKed
// on its oracle for every diff before any reviewer was dispatched. CI stayed green throughout,
// because CI runs unsandboxed, and nothing noticed for a day: no PR had ever completed a gate
// run. Neither test was wrong and neither change was wrong. Two correct requirements collided,
// and no mechanism was watching the seam.
//
// This preload turns the next collision into a red test, in the gate's own oracle, with the
// reason attached.
//
// ── THE RULE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// A write is refused when it lands inside a directory this repo's own harness lives in:
//
//     <repo>/.claude/agents      <repo>/.claude/commands     <repo>/.claude/hooks
//     <repo>/.claude/skills      <repo>/.claude/workflows    <repo>/.claude/settings.json
//     <repo>/design/tokens       ~/.claude
//
// That is ONE armed session's deny set, measured 2026-08-24 at the SESSION ROOT under
// `sandbox.enabled: true` + `failIfUnavailable: true`. It is not a reading of the sandbox's own
// rule, which belongs to the binary and is not exposed to a process. Everything else under
// .claude/ was writable in the same probe — memory/, playbooks/, lenses.yml, review-lenses.yml,
// qa-tier-floor.yml, mcp-policy.json — as was the repo root.
//
// AND THE DENY SET IS PER SESSION ROOT, WHICH IS THE TRAP. The same probe run inside a NESTED
// worktree reported .claude/hooks, .claude/skills and .claude/workflows as WRITABLE, because the
// deny entries name the open project's paths literally. A test can therefore pass in a child
// worktree and EPERM at the session root, which is where the gate runs — that is how the
// .claude/hooks half of this defect was nearly scoped out as "not reproducing". This list is a
// floor over both locations rather than a mirror of either, which is also why it is stated as a
// floor in limit 1 and not as the sandbox's answer.
//
// Fixture writes elsewhere in the tree are left alone — scripts/lenses.test.mjs writes
// .lens-fixture-*.yml at the repo root and is not doing anything wrong. The paths are anchored
// at the REAL repo root, so a test that copies the tree into os.tmpdir() and edits
// .claude/hooks/ THERE is unaffected. That is the seam this guard is asking for.
//
// ── WHAT IT CATCHES ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// A synchronous `fs` mutation, from the preloaded process or any Node child that inherits the
// flag, that resolves into one of those paths. It catches it however the path was spelled — a
// constant, a join, a variable — because it checks the resolved argument at call time.
//
// ── WHAT IT DOES NOT CATCH, STATED SO NOBODY OVER-READS IT ──────────────────────────────────
//   1. It is a HARDCODED list, not a reading of the sandbox. The runtime's real deny set is
//      not exposed to a process, and settings.json does not hold these entries — they are the
//      binary's own protections. If the runtime widens its deny set, this list will not follow;
//      treat it as a floor.
//   2. Only SYNCHRONOUS fs mutators — the list below. A callback or promise write
//      (fs.writeFile, fs.promises.writeFile, fs.createWriteStream) passes unnoticed.
//      scripts/protected-write.test.mjs asserts textually that no guarded test file reaches for
//      one; that assertion is a grep and indirection defeats it.
//   3. Non-Node children. A test that shells out to `sed` or a shell redirect writes freely.
//   4. Only the npm scripts that preload it — every `node --test` step of `npm run check`. A
//      non-test step of that chain is unguarded. beeond's ci.yml has no direct `node --test`
//      invocation, and scripts/check-suite.test.mjs refuses one, so there is no unguarded test
//      step on the runner today; that is a property to keep, not a permanent fact.
//   5. It says nothing about reads, and nothing about the credential `denyRead` paths.

/**
 * The paths whose CONTENTS are the harness, or are the trust boundary of a generated artifact.
 *
 * REPOINTED FOR beeond 2026-08-31. The `.claude/**` entries are carried over unchanged and every
 * one of them exists here — they are the directories a probe found write-denied at agentvibe's
 * session root on 2026-08-24, and the deny set belongs to the runtime rather than to a repository,
 * so it does not change when the repository does. `design/tokens` is beeond's own addition and is
 * the only entry that is not agentvibe's.
 *
 * WHY design/tokens IS HERE, AND WHY IT IS THE DIRECTORY RATHER THAN JUST seeds.json.
 * `.claude/qa-tier-floor.yml` floors `design/tokens/seeds.json` at `full` and calls it "THE TRUST
 * BOUNDARY of the token pipeline", because every generated artifact descends from that one
 * hand-authored file and `build-tokens --check` cannot see a poisoned seed by construction — it
 * compares the committed output against a fresh generation from those same seeds, so poisoned
 * seeds yield a poisoned file the comparison calls correct. A test that wrote a fixture into
 * seeds.json would be forging that boundary.
 *
 * The GENERATED files beside it are protected for a second, independent reason: design/tokens/
 * tokens.json is the oracle scripts/design-probe.mjs measures rendered pages against, and
 * tokens.ts is imported by the app build. A test that rewrote either would not make a check fail —
 * it would make the probe PASS against an oracle the test had authored, and `check:tokens` would
 * then report drift that looks like a designer's edit. Both failure modes are silent, which is the
 * property that puts a path on this list.
 *
 * IT COSTS NOTHING TODAY AND THE COST IS WORTH NAMING ANYWAY: `npm run build:tokens` regenerates
 * files inside this directory and is NOT affected, because it carries no `--require` preload — the
 * tripwire only loads inside `node --test` steps. What WOULD be refused is a preloaded test that
 * invokes the generator in-process against the real output directory. No test does that today
 * (scripts/build-tokens.test.mjs writes every fixture into os.tmpdir()), and if one ever needs to,
 * the remedy is a temp root, not an entry removed from here.

// POSTURE: library. `scripts/ledger.mjs` turns a `fail`/`unresolved` on a
// `enforcement: block` path into exit 1, and logs everything else to events.jsonl.
//
// scripts/lib/resolvers.js — the four claim resolvers, and the registry of their names.
//
// THE ONE INVARIANT: no resolver returns `pass` when it could not check.
//
// A resolver has exactly three outcomes:
//   pass        it checked, and the claim holds
//   fail        it checked, and the claim does not hold
//   unresolved  it could not check — no network, nothing judged it yet, command absent
//
// `unresolved` is treated as a would_block, never as a pass. This is the whole
// difference between a gate and a decoration. `schema-lint.js` still contains the
// opposite pattern — `catch { LIVE_SKILLS = null }`, which turns an unreadable manifest
// into a silently skipped check — and that shape is why fabrications survived eight
// weeks of green builds.
//
// WHY NETWORK RESOLVERS NEVER GUARD A BLOCKING PATH
// `claim-source` needs the internet, so an outage makes it `unresolved`, which on a
// blocking path would fail the build for a reason unrelated to the change. The tier map
// resolves this by construction rather than by weakening the invariant: every path
// carrying `enforcement: block` uses `claim-command` only. Network-dependent claims live
// on shadow paths, where an outage produces an honest log line and a green build.

//   waive      checking is postponed until a date. Live → `pass` with the deadline shown.

// The sibling `claim-judge` checks the SHAPE of a judgment somebody else recorded. This
// one CALLS a judge — a second model family, out of process.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT DO, stated first because the obvious reading is wrong. This resolver
// does NOT satisfy the `risk: high` requirement of >=2 distinct model families. It
// returns its own verdict and writes NOTHING back into `evidence.judged_by`, so the
// family count `claim-judge` computes is unmoved. Measured on a risk:high claim with a
// one-family panel and a conformant external pass:
//
//   claim-judge          -> fail | risk:high needs >=2 model families, got 1 (anthropic)
//   claim-judge-external -> pass | second-family judge ... returned pass
//
// The aggregate still blocks, which is the correct direction — but an earlier draft of
// this header called it "the only route to the >=2 family requirement", and that
// overstated a seam into a satisfied requirement. Making the requirement genuinely
// satisfiable means writing a judgment back into the ledger source, which is a founder
// decision about ledger provenance and is deliberately not taken here. What this resolver
// is: an independent second opinion that can BLOCK, recorded with an attestation.
//
// THE TRAP THAT DEFERRED THIS FOR WEEKS, AND THE RULE THAT COMES OUT OF IT
// Codex bug #19945: `codex exec` returns EXIT 0 WITH 0-BYTE STDOUT when stdio is detached
// from a TTY — which is precisely how a resolver runs it (bug #4721 does the same for
// SIGINT, returning 0 rather than 130). A resolver that read exit 0 as a pass would
// manufacture judgments that were never made, on the highest-risk claims in the ledger.
//
// So: THIS RESOLVER NEVER READS THE EXIT CODE. Not as a pass, not as a fail. It gates on
// a positively identified turn-completion marker in the binary's own event stream, plus a
// verdict the judge stated in its own words. Absent either, the answer is `unresolved`
// with a reason naming WHICH precondition failed — absent binary, no turn completion,
// no verdict, contradictory verdicts, timeout — because an `unresolved` that does not say
// why sends the next person to re-derive it.
//
// Every one of those is indistinguishable from "judged, no objection" if you squint, and
// that is the whole point: a negative result is evidence only next to a control that
// fires. The control lives in the tests — a stub emitting a real, conformant verdict must
// resolve pass/fail, or the five negative cases prove only that the resolver is inert.
//
// ASYMMETRY (MODEL-DIVERSITY.md): a second-family judge may turn PASS into BLOCK, never
// BLOCK into PASS. Implemented below by refusing to call the binary at all when the
// recorded panel already dissents — a flaky or absent judge degrades to "no second
// opinion", never to a false pass.
//
// WHAT IT COSTS TO RUN, stated because it is not obvious: this spawns a process and that
// process talks to a vendor API, sending the claim's assertion text off this machine. It
// is therefore BOTH a command resolver and a network resolver, and honours `--no-exec`
// and `--offline` alike. Nothing in `.claude/qa-tier-floor.yml` names it, so it does not
// run unless a rule is added — and per this file's header, a network-dependent resolver

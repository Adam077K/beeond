// POSTURE: library — it never exits. Its callers block: `scripts/ledger.mjs` and
// `.claude/hooks/schema-lint.js` both turn a non-empty issue list into exit 1.
//
// scripts/lib/claims.js — the claim schema, and a STRICT parser for claim blocks.
//
// WHY STRICT IS THE WHOLE POINT
// Two parsers in this repository have already failed by returning empty instead of
// failing. `build-skills-manifest.mjs` had a line-wise reader that silently produced
// an empty description for the 4 skills using folded YAML, and `schema-lint.js` still
// sets LIVE_SKILLS = null in a catch block, disabling its own skill check whenever the
// manifest will not parse. A claim parser with that shape would report "0 claims, all
// good" for a file full of unverifiable assertions — the exact failure the ledger
// exists to prevent.
//
// So every function here REFUSES what it cannot classify. There is no path that
// swallows a malformed block and returns []. Unparseable input throws ClaimError with
// a line number; unrecognized structure throws; a tab in indentation throws; a
// duplicate key throws. `null` and `[]` mean "there were genuinely no claims here",
// and nothing else can produce them.
//
// A claim lives INSIDE the artifact it supports, in one of two forms:
//
//   1. A fenced block in any markdown file:
//        ```claims
//        claims:
//          - id: c-example
//            ...
//        ```
//   2. A `claims:` key in YAML frontmatter (for files that already carry frontmatter).
//
// Code carries claims through form 2 on its test file, or through a `verified_by:
// command` claim whose `cmd` runs the binding test. There is no third parser.

// ── Block scalars ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Read from the RAW source, never from the scanned array. `scanLines` is a whole-document
// pre-pass: before any structure is known it drops blank lines, drops `#`-first lines, strips
// trailing comments, strips trailing whitespace and strips leading indentation. All five are
// right for a plain scalar and all five destroy a block-scalar body — and two of them (a
// dropped blank line, a dropped `#`-first line) remove the line from `lines[]` ENTIRELY, so
// the body is not reconstructible from what the scan returned. Measured against PyYAML 6.0.3
// and js-yaml 4.1.1 before this function existed: a `#` after a space truncated the value, a
// `#`-first line vanished, a blank line vanished (destroying the fold boundary in `>`),
// relative indentation flattened to column 0, and trailing whitespace was stripped. One live
// value was corrupt because of it — `.claude/skills/CURATION.yml` added[9].why.
//
// CHOMPING IS `strip`, DELIBERATELY, FOR ALL FOUR ACCEPTED INDICATORS. YAML's default is
// `clip`, which keeps one trailing newline. This parser has always applied `strip`, so `|`
// agrees with `|-` and `>` with `>-`; the differential probe records `|-` and `>-` as already
// matching both reference implementations byte for byte. Adopting `clip` would change all 15
// block-scalar values in `.claude/gates.yml` — an `irreversible`-tier surface — to recover
// ZERO content, and would split `|` from `|-` where they agree today.
//
// FIVE DIVERGENCES INSIDE BLOCK SCALARS ARE ENUMERATED BELOW, EACH WITH A ROW IN THE
// CROSS-CHECK LIST IN `scripts/claims.test.mjs`. **THIS LIST IS NOT KNOWN TO BE EXHAUSTIVE,
// AND NOTHING HERE CAN MAKE IT SO.** Two earlier drafts of this comment claimed totality —
// first "the trailing newline is the only remaining difference", then "FOUR DIVERGENCES
// REMAIN" — and each was refuted by a divergence nobody had listed. The reason is structural
// and worth stating rather than repeating the mistake a third time:
//
//   THE CROSS-CHECK LIST IS A ONE-DIRECTIONAL CONTROL. It fires when a LISTED row stops
//   diverging. Nothing fires when a divergence is MISSING from the list — which is the
//   direction that failed twice.
//
// The bidirectional control — a sweep that fails when ANY unlisted divergence exists — needs
// a reference parser to compare against, and this repo declares zero dependencies, so no
// reference is resolvable on CI. Such a sweep could therefore only ever be developer-run and
// advisory, never blocking. That is why this comment is SCOPED instead: it claims what has
// been enumerated and measured, and claims nothing about what has not. Read "divergence"
// below as "inside a block scalar", with ONE declared exception: row 4 also names a
// consequence of the same mechanism in a QUOTED scalar, and flags that in place rather than
// relying on this sentence. Outside block scalars the parser is a documented subset and
// diverges on anchors, tags, `0x10`, and multi-line plain and quoted scalars by design.
//
//   1. Chomping is `strip`, not `clip` — `|`/`>` drop a trailing newline the references keep.
//   2. `|+`, `>+` and `|2` are not implemented, and are NOT reliably refused. With a
//      more-indented body they throw `unexpected indentation`. With NO body, or a body of only
//      blank or `#`-first lines — which `scanLines` deletes before this code runs — the value
//      silently becomes the literal indicator string: `a: |+\nb: 2` yields `{a: "|+"}` where
//      the references yield `{a: ""}`. That string also clears `validateEvidence`'s
//      `.trim() !== ''` floor, which `""` would not. Pre-existing; named, not fixed here.
//   3. An empty block scalar THROWS where the references return `""`. Deliberate: a silently
//      empty value is the failure this parser exists to refuse.
//   4. THE SIXTH LOSS, NOT FIXED BY THIS CHANGE and not fixable from here: `scanLines` runs
//      `stripComment` over every line of the document, block-scalar bodies included, so an odd
//      apostrophe in a body throws `unterminated quote` and takes the WHOLE DOCUMENT with it.
//      THE MECHANISM IS WIDER THAN THIS ROW: the same quote tracking now also throws on a CR
//      inside a quoted scalar — `k: 'a\rb'` — where the references give `"a b"`. Base and
//      round 1 returned `"a\rb"`, so this round changed it from silently-wrong to refused.
//      Fail-closed and, for a quoted scalar carrying a stray CR, defensible; both the single-
//      and double-quoted forms behave this way, and both are pinned in the tests.
//      `k: |-\n  the judge's verdict` is unparseable; both references read it. The raw-source
//      read below cannot rescue it because the throw happens first, in the pre-pass. Live
//      instance: `.claude/agents/reviewer-readonly.md` frontmatter, which `schema-lint` reads
//      with its own `parseFrontmatter` and so does not hit. This fix makes the block-scalar
//      VALUE content; the ADMISSION decision is still made by the line scanner.
//   5. A block scalar as a SEQUENCE ITEM — `k:\n  - |-\n    a` — throws `unexpected
//      indentation` where the references read it as a list of one string. Pre-existing,
//      unchanged by this diff, and FAIL-CLOSED: it refuses rather than inventing a value.
//      Named, deliberately not fixed here — `parseSeq` builds a synthetic line for the
//      "- key:" form only, and teaching it the bare "- |-" form is its own change.

 * whose entire purpose is to stop assertions being accepted where evidence was required.
 *
 * `scripts/ledger.mjs` still decides which prose citations resolve by SET MEMBERSHIP,
 * `projectIds.has(id)`, and never opens the record, so a deprecated id passes `lint`
 * exactly as a live one does. That gap is real and is documented where it lives, in
 * `checkCitations`'s preamble, together with the measurement showing why the obvious
 * predicate is wrong: supersession and historical record are legitimate reasons for
 * prose to name a retired claim, and a set lookup cannot tell them from an assertion.
 * This function is here so that when someone closes that properly — most likely with a
 * `supersedes:` field — there is one place to change, not two.
 *
 * `waive` is deliberately NOT deprecation. A waiver is a dated promise to come back;

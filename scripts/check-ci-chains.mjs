// POSTURE: BLOCKS, IN ITS OWN RIGHT. `check:ci-chains` is a STEP of `npm run check` and a step of
// .github/workflows/ci.yml here, so this file's exit code fails a build on its own.
//
// *Corrected for beeond 2026-08-31, and this one UNDER-claimed rather than over-claimed. It read
// "POSTURE: entry point. The BLOCKING assertion is in `scripts/check-suite.test.mjs`, which is a
// step of `npm run check`; this script is the same property runnable on its own." That describes
// agentvibe, where the identical script is EXCLUDED precisely so one property is not asserted under
// two names. Here it is not a duplicate of anything: `scripts/check-suite.test.mjs` is EXCLUDED,
// so this file is the ONLY thing in beeond that reads the workflow at all. It survives that
// exclusion because `ciChainFindings()` is pure over the workflow text and holds no assertion
// about which steps a repository has — which is exactly the coupling that put the other file out.
// NOTE WHAT IT DOES AND DOES NOT COVER: the shell-chain predicate, and nothing else. The
// `!cancelled()` guard on every step, `continue-on-error` never appearing as a key, every STEP
// having a counterpart step, and no step invoking a runner directly are all assertions of the
// excluded file, and none of them runs today. When it is re-ported and green, this becomes the
// duplicate agentvibe says it is and belongs back in EXCLUDED. The reasoning is written out at the
// `check:ci-chains` entry in STEPS, in scripts/lib/check-suite.js.*
//
// scripts/check-ci-chains.mjs — report `run:` values in .github/workflows/ci.yml that put more than
// one command behind one exit code.
//
// ── WHY THIS EXISTS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The suite's operator check only ever saw package.json script bodies, reached through
// resolveChain(scripts, step). The workflow's raw `run:` text was never fed to it, so
// `run: npm run a && npm run b` written straight into the workflow bypassed package.json and STEPS
// entirely — `&&` skips the rest on the first failure, and `;`, `|` and `&` hand back the LAST
// command's status so the failure disappears with no red step at all.
//
// The predicate and the allowlist live in scripts/lib/check-suite.js, next to the STEPS rules they
// mirror, and ciChainFindings() is pure over both of its inputs so the tests can drive it against
// mutated workflow text. This file is only the file read and the exit code.
